== Context and Problem Statement

// Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.

Users of the Stackable platform often times want to stay on a specific product version - sometime also platform version.
While staying on a specific set of versions would theoretically work, the customers often want security updates, hence the reason we need to maintain older versions - for operators as well as product versions.

We currently don't have CRD versioning yet, this will be added in the future.

Currently we do support the last 3 Kubernetes versions.

== Decision Drivers

* Customer requirements for stability, but also security updates
* Maintenance/support effort

== Considered Options



=== No LTS versions
We don't have any LTS release.
Instead we support the last *X* releases, so users have approx. *X* months of time to upgrade the operators.

==== Pros
* No maintenance effort

==== Cons
* There are no guarantee for users how long their stuff will be supported



=== Time-based LTS versions
We mark specific Stackable platform releases (e.g. the first within a year) as LTS releases.
We do support them for *X* months.

==== Pros
* There is a guarantee for users how long their stuff will be supported

==== Cons
* Maintenance/support effort



=== LTS CRD versions
1. Alpha API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.
2. Beta API versions are deprecated at a minimum of *1* platform releases after introduction and removed at a minimum of *1* platform releases after deprecation.
3. GA (stable) API versions are deprecated at a minimum of *2* platform releases after introduction and removed at a minimum of *1* platform releases after deprecation.

In addition to the CRD versions we support the operators of the last *2* releases, so users have approx. *6* months of time to upgrade the operators.

Image the following CRD version timeline:

For the give timeline every release notes for a Stackable platform release contains something similar to the following:

*Release 23.7*

Added CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v1alpha2
* ZookeeperCluster v1beta2
* ZookeeperCluster v1

*Release 23.10*

Added CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v2alpha1

Removed CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v1alpha2

Deprecated CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v1beta2

*Release 24.1*

Added CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v2
* ZookeeperCluster v3

Removed CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v1beta2

Deprecated CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v1

*Release 24.7*

Removed CRD versions:

* ZookeeperCluster v1 => If a customer really needs this version he can pay us to not remove the version in this release. It will stay deprecated and will be removed in a future once the customer does not pay us sufficient money any more.

Open questions: How do we handle support questions for deprecated versions?


==== Pros
* This mechanism gives us the possibility to try out experimental features in an alpha version to get feedback. Afterwards we can add it as beta or stable feature.

==== Cons
* Customers can't switch to newer operators if they have an really old Kubernetes version.
As we have a similar Kubernetes support cycle than the Kubernetes project itself chances are pretty high they are running on an EOL Kubernetes version already.

== Decision Outcome

Option <<LTS CRD versions>> was chosen.
