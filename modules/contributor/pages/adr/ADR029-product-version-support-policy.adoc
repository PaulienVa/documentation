== Context and Problem Statement

// Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.

Users of the Stackable platform often times want to stay on a specific product version - sometime also platform version.
While staying on a specific set of versions would theoretically work, the customers often want security updates, hence the reason we need to maintain older versions - for operators as well as product versions.

We currently don't have CRD versioning yet, this will be added in the future.

Currently we do support the last 3 Kubernetes versions.

== Decision Drivers

* Customer requirements for stability, but also security updates
* Maintenance/support effort

== Considered Options

// Alpha API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.
//
// Beta API versions are deprecated at a minimum of *1* platform releases after introduction and removed at a minimum of *1* platform releases after deprecation.
//
// GA (stable) API versions are deprecated at a minimum of *2* platform releases after introduction and removed at a minimum of *1* platform releases after deprecation.


Patch level versions can be replaced by newer patch level versions in any release without prior deprecation notice.
