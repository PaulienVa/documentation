of the best ways of getting started with a new platform is to try it out. Any big data platform has a lot of moving parts and getting some hands on keyboard time with it helps reinforce learning. Firstly, let’s cover whether this Getting Started guide is right for you. This is intended as a learning tool to discover more about Stackable, its deployment and architecture. If you want to build a production cluster then this is not for you. This tutorial is to familiarise you with the Stackable architecture and is not a guide for building robust clusters. This is intended for use in a private network or lab; it doesn’t enable many security features such as authentication or encryption and should not be directly connected to the Internet. Be careful if you’re deploying in the cloud as your instances may default to using public IPs. Stackable is based on Kubernetes and uses this as the control plane to manage clusters. In this guide we will build a simple cluster with 3 services; Apache ZooKeeper, Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi. Stackable’s control plane is built around Kubernetes, and we’ll give some brief examples of how to install Kubernetes on your machine. Stackable operators and their services are managed by applying manifest files to the Kubernetes cluster. For this purpose, you need to have the kubectl tool installed. Follow the instructions here for your platform. Kind offers a very quick and easy way to bootstrap your Kubernetes infrastructure in Docker. The big advantage of this is that you can simply remove the Docker containers when you’re finished and clean up easily, making it great for testing and development. If you don’t already have Docker then visit Docker Website to find out how to install Docker. Kind is a single executable that performs the tasks of installing and configuring Kubernetes for you within Docker containers. The Kind Website has instructions for installing Kind on your system. Once you have both of these installed then you can build a Kubernetes cluster in Docker. We’re going to create a 2 node cluster to test out Stackable, one node hosting the Kubernetes control plane and the other hosting the Stackable services. kind create cluster --name quickstart --config - 45m v1.21.1 172.18.0.2 Ubuntu 21.04 5.15.0-25-generic containerd://1.5.2 With the following command we get the port (in this case 30247): kubectl get svc simple-nifi NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE simple-nifi NodePort 10.43.75.25 8443:30247/TCP 49m Browse to the address of your Kubernetes node on port 30247 e.g. https://172.18.0.2:30247/nifi and you should see the NiFi login screen. The Apache NiFi operator will automatically generate the admin user credentials with a random password and store it as a Kubernetes secret in order to provide some security out of the box. You can retrieve this password for the admin user with the following kubectl command. kubectl get secrets nifi-admin-credentials-simple \\ -o jsonpath=\"{.data.password}\" | base64 -d && echo Once you have these credentials you can log in and you should see a blank NiFi canvas.","title":"Getting Started","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"getting_started","url":"/home/stable/getting_started.html","titles":[{"text":"About this guide","hash":"_about_this_guide","id":1},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":2},{"text":"Installing Kubernetes","hash":"_installing_kubernetes","id":3},{"text":"Installing kubectl","hash":"_installing_kubectl","id":4},{"text":"Installing Kubernetes using Kind","hash":"_installing_kubernetes_using_kind","id":5},{"text":"Installing Kubernetes using K3s","hash":"_installing_kubernetes_using_k3s","id":6},{"text":"Testing your Kubernetes installation","hash":"_testing_your_kubernetes_installation","id":7},{"text":"Installing Stackable","hash":"_installing_stackable","id":8},{"text":"Install stackablectl","hash":"_install_stackablectl","id":9},{"text":"Installing Stackable Operators","hash":"_installing_stackable_operators","id":10},{"text":"Deploying Stackable Services","hash":"_deploying_stackable_services","id":11},{"text":"Apache ZooKeeper","hash":"_apache_zookeeper","id":12},{"text":"Apache Kafka","hash":"_apache_kafka","id":13},{"text":"Apache NiFi","hash":"_apache_nifi","id":14},{"text":"Testing your cluster","hash":"_testing_your_cluster","id":15},{"text":"Apache ZooKeeper","hash":"_apache_zookeeper_2","id":16},{"text":"Apache Kafka","hash":"_apache_kafka_2","id":17},{"text":"Apache NiFi","hash":"_apache_nifi_2","id":18}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"Welcome to Stackable! This documentation gives you an overview of the Stackable Data Platform, how to install and manage it as well as some tutorials. Our first release - June 2022 We are proud to announce our first public release! Please read the release notes to read up on the details. The Stackable Data Platform allows you to deploy, scale and manage Data infrastructure in any environment running Kubernetes. You can find an overview of the supported components below, as well as a full list of all supported product versions here. If you have any feedback regarding the documentation please either open an issue, ask a question or look at the source for this documentation in its repository. We are building a distribution of existing Open Source tools that together comprise the components of a modern data platform. There are components to ingest data, to store data, to process and visualize and much more. While the platform got started in the Big Data ecosystem we are in no way limited to big data workloads. You can declaratively build these environments, and we don’t stop at the tool level as we also provide ways for the users to interact with the platform in the \"as Code\"-approach. We are leveraging the Open Policy Agent to provide Security-as-Code. We are building a distribution that includes the “best of breed” of existing Open Source tools, but bundles them in a way, so it is easy to deploy a fully working stack of software. Most of the existing tools are “single purpose” tools, which often do not play nicely together out-of-the-box. We are using Kubernetes as our deployment platform. And we’re building Operators for each of the products we support.

Authorization policies are defined in the Rego language, divided into packages and supplied via ConfigMaps. Every node is running an OPA instance for fast policy evaluation and products are connected to OPA with the service discovery mechanism. OPA is an open source, general purpose policy engine. It supports a high-level declarative language called Rego. Rego enables you to specify complex policies as code and transfer the decision-making processes from your software to OPA. Policies written in Rego are called Rego rules. Policy requests are made to a REST API, which allows easy requests from microservices, Kubernetes or CI/CD pipelines. In the request the requester can supply arbitrary structured input data as JSON to supply context information to the policy decision rules. For example the name of the user, resource and action for which an authorization is requested. In this way policy decision-making and policy enforcement are decoupled. OPA is run by the Stackable OPA operator. OPA is deployed with the OpaCluster resource, from which the operator creates a DaemonSet to run an OPA instance on every node of the cluster. Because of this, every Pod making policy requests will always make the request locally, minimizing latency and network traffic. OPA by itself does not enforce a specific structure of Rego rules and the packages they are in, but the Stackable platform makes some assumptions. Whenever a product is connected to OPA (see Connect a product), a single package needs to be given, and that package needs to contain specific rules depending on the product. For example for Druid, a single allow rule needs to be defined. The Rego rule policies are supplied as ConfigMaps. Multiple ConfigMaps can be used for multiple packages, for example one package for Druid authorization, one package for a Trino development instance and one package for a Trino production instance. ConfigMaps were chosen as an easy to use method of supplying configuration files in a Kubernetes environment. The operator takes care of assembling the ConfigMaps into a policy bundle, every policy ConfigMap must contain a opa.stackable.tech/bundle label in order to be processed by the OPA operator. Here’s an example of a Rego rule package in a ConfigMap: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: my-product-policies labels: opa.stackable.tech/bundle: \"my-product\" (1) data: my-product.rego: | package my-product (2) import future.keywords.in default allow = false (3) allow { is_admin } is_admin() { (4) input.context.identity.user == \"admin\" } 1 The opa.stackable.tech/bundle label is needed to add this ConfigMap to the OPA policy set. Only ConfigMaps with this label are included. 2 my-product is the name of the package. Usually you will have one package per product or per product instance. The name of the package needs to be configured in product instances (i.e. a Trino or Druid instance). The product will use the policies from the configured policy package. 3 The allow rule. It is the main entry point. For every policy decision, the allow rule is always requested. In this case, the rule defaults to false. It references the is_admin rule. 4 The is_admin rule. It demonstrates the use of context information. Every policy decision request can supply context, in this case the user identity is supplied as context. Only if the user identity is \"admin\", the is_admin rule evaluates to true. The combination of arbitrary input data and the Rego rules enables you to specify and enforce almost any kind of policies. You can define powerful policies for e.g. user access for database tables, schemas, columns etc. You can enforce local network traffic, access time periods and many more. See the OPA documentation for further examples. To connect a product to an OpaCluster, the name of the OpaCluster is needed as well as the name of the policy package to use with this product instance. An operator that supports OPA for its operated product will have a spec section like this: spec: ... opa: configMapName: simple-opa (1) package: my-product (2) ... 1 The reference to the OPA cluster 2 The name of the policy package to use for this product The automatic connection is facilitated by the service discovery mechanism and no further information about OPA is required. The products query their respective rules via the supplied package name. See Further reading for links to specific product authorization documentation.

Airflow users can access DAG jobs this way, and Spark users can do the same for data or other job dependencies, to name just two examples. A PersistentVolume will usually be provisioned by the Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) on behalf of the cluster administrator, who will take into account the type of storage that is required. This will include, for example, an appropriate sizing, and relevant access modes (which in turn are dependent on the StorageClass chosen to back the PersistentVolume). The relationship between a PersistentVolume and a PersistentVolumeClaim can be illustrated by these two examples: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: task-pv-volume labels: type: local spec: storageClassName: manual (1) capacity: storage: 10Gi (2) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce (3) hostPath: path: \"/mnt/data\" --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: task-pv-claim spec: storageClassName: manual (4) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 3Gi (5) 1 The name of the storage class, which will be used by the PersistentVolumeClaim 2 The capacity of the PersistentVolume 3 a list of access modes 4 The storageClassName which is used to match a PersistentVolume to a claim 5 The specific quantity of the resource that is being claimed Not all storage classes support all access modes. The supported access modes also depend on the Kubernetes implementation, see for example the compatiblity table Supported access modes for PVs in the OpenShift documentation. Other managed Kubernetes implementations will be similar, albeit with different default storage class names. The important point is that the default StorageClass only supports ReadWriteOnce, which limits access to the PersistentVolumeClaim to a single node. A strategy governing PersistentVolumeClaim resources will thus address the following: what access mode is appropriate? Will the resources be accessed by multiple pods and/or modes? does the Kubernetes cluster have a default implementation for these access modes? if access modes are restricted (e.g. ReadWriteOnce), does the cluster prioritise available resources over implicit application dependencies (in other words, is the PersistentVolumeClaim treated as a soft- or hard-dependency)? If a PersistentVolumeClaim should be mounted on a single node for the application and its components that use it, this can be specified explicitly (see the next section). The Kubernetes documentation states the following with regard to assigning pods to specific nodes: the scheduler will automatically do a reasonable placement (for example, spreading your Pods across nodes so as not place Pods on a node with insufficient free resources). This suggests that resources are automatically considered when pods are assigned to nodes, but it is not clear if the same is true for implicit dependencies, such as PersistentVolumeClaim usage by multiple pods. The scheduler will take various factors into account, such as …​individual and collective resource requirements, hardware / software / policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference…​. but implementations may vary in the way soft dependencies (e.g. optimal resource usage) and hard dependencies (e.g. access modes, that may prevent the job from running) are handled and prioritised. For PersistentVolumeClaim-relevant tests in the Stackable operator repositories the backing PersistentVolume is omitted as this is an implementation decision to be made by the cluster administrator and mocking e.g. an NFS volume for tests is non-trivial. If the only viable access mode is ReadWriteOnce (see above) - meaning that all test steps dependent on a PersistentVolumeClaim should be run on the same node - this assignment should be made explicitly with a declaration of either a node selector or pod-affinity. Managed Kubernetes clusters will normally have a default storage implementation for access modes other than ReadWriteOnce so e.g. ReadWriteMany can be declared for tests running against such clusters in the knowledge that the appropriate storage will be used. The Airflow operator can use a PersistentVolumeClaim for externally-loaded airflow jobs, known as Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), as shown in this example. Airflow expects that all components (webserver, scheduler and workers) have access to the DAG folder, so the PersistentVolumeClaim either has to be accessible with the ReadWriteMany access mode or node selection should be declared to ensure all components run on the same node. Users of the Spark-k8s operator have a variety of ways to manage SparkApplication dependencies, one of which is to mount resources on a PersistentVolumeClaim. An example is shown here.

Think of a client communicating with a server. Stackable calls these roles. The roles or processes are often replicated multiple times. These replicas can further be subdivided into role groups. Roles and role groups are defined in the resource manifest. The use of roles and role groups is required to control how processes are configured and where they run. Different processes have different tasks that they need to fulfill, which in turn have different configuration settings that only apply to that task. For example coordination, storage, logging and processing tasks require different amounts of threads, memory and storage capacity. These different settings can be put in the per role configuration spec. While configuration is concerned with modifying how the process works on the inside, scheduling is concerned with the context where it should run inside the cluster. A processing task should be scheduled on a node with faster CPUs or nodes with GPUs attached. A caching process is best scheduled on a node with SSD storage, for example. This is done by using label selectors. Nodes can be labeled and then processes can be assigned to nodes based on these labels. Role groups are motivated by the need to subdivide the replicas of a process into groups as well, either to configure or to schedule multiple groups differently. For example in a cluster spanning multiple physical locations, you may want to make sure half of your processes run in one location and half in the other. A distributed software consists of one or more roles. Every role must be configured with at least one role group. Configuration can be specified at role level or at role group level, where the role group level overrides the role level. Label selectors for scheduling and the number of replicas are specified on the role group, not role. The role group is the lowest level, so it makes sense to have to specify this there. HDFS uses three distinct processes that work together to fulfill its duty: NameNodes, DataNodes and JournalNodes. With roles you can specify different configuration settings for each of these, as well as schedule them on specific machines. apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HdfsCluster metadata: name: simple-hdfs spec: journalNodes: roleGroups: default: replicas: 3 (1) nameNodes: roleGroups: default: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: kubernetes.io/os: linux (2) dataNodes: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 1Gi (3) roleGroups: default: replicas: 2 hiCapacity: (4) config: resources: storage: data: 2Gi replicas: 1 ... 1 The JournalNode role with only a single default role group. For the role group 3 replicas are specified, specifying a replica count is optional, the default is 1. 2 For the NameNodes default role group, a label selector is given, the pods should only be specified on nodes where the kubernetes.io/os label has the value linux. 3 A common config setting for the DataNodes role. This configuration setting applies only to pods for this role. 4 The DataNode role has two role groups, the default group and the hiCapacity group. In it the config setting for the group is overridden with a higher value of 2Gi. This role group has only one replica. Every operator uses roles. Have a look at the usage page of an operator for an example of roles.","title":"Roles and role groups","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"roles-and-role-groups","url":"/home/stable/concepts/roles-and-role-groups.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Scheduling","hash":"_scheduling","id":3},{"text":"Role groups","hash":"_role_groups","id":4},{"text":"How it works","hash":"_how_it_works","id":5},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":6},{"text":"Further Reading","hash":"_further_reading","id":7}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Many of the tools on the Stackable platform integrate with S3 storage in some way. For example Druid can ingest data from S3 and also use S3 as a backend for deep storage, Spark can use an S3 bucket to store application files and data. Stackable uses S3Connection and S3Bucket objects to configure access to S3 storage. An S3Connection object contains information such as the host name of the S3 server, it’s port, TLS parameters and access credentials. An S3Bucket contains the name of the bucket and a reference to an S3Connection, the connection to the server where the bucket is located. An S3Connection can be referenced by multiple buckets. Here’s an example of a simple S3Connection object and an S3Bucket referencing that connection: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Connection metadata: name: my-connection-resource spec: host: s3.example.com port: 4242 --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Bucket metadata: name: my-bucket-resource spec: bucketName: my-example-bucket connection: reference: my-connection-resource S3Bucket(s) reference S3Connection(s) objects. Both types of objects can be referenced by other resources. For example in a DruidCluster you can specify a bucket for deep storage and an S3Connection for data ingestion. S3Connection objects can be defined in a standalone fashion or they can be inlined into a bucket object. Similarly a bucket can be defined in a standalone object or inlined into an enclosing object. The diagram above shows three examples of how the objects can be structured. In option 1 all objects are separate from each other. This provides maximum re-usability because the same connection or bucket object can be referenced by multiple resources. It also allows for separation of concerns across team members. Cluster administrators can define S3 connection objects that developers reference in their applications. In option 2 the bucket is inlined in the cluster definition. This makes sense if you have a dedicated bucket for a specific purpose, if it is only used in this one cluster instance, in this single product. Option 3 shows all S3 objects inlined in a DruidCluster resource. This is a very convenient way to quickly test something since the entire configuration is encapsulated in a single but potentially large manifest. To clarify the concept, a few examples will be given, using a DruidCluster resource as an example. apiVersion: druid.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: DruidCluster metadata: name: my-druid-cluster spec: deepStorage: # to be defined ... # more spec here ... The inline definition is variant 3 in the figure above. This variant has the advantage that everything is defined in a single file, right where it is going to be used: apiVersion: druid.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: DruidCluster metadata: name: my-druid-cluster spec: deepStorage: s3: inline: (1) bucketName: my-bucket connection: inline: (2) host: test-minio port: 9000 # more spec here ... 1 The inline definition of the bucket. The bucket definition contains bucketName and connection. 2 The inline definition of the connection. It contains the host and port. Often multiple buckets are used across a data pipeline, as well as buckets being used by different applications, so stand-alone resource definitions that can be referenced from multiple objects make sense. The DruidCluster references the S3Bucket, which in turn references the S3Connection. First the definition of the S3Connection: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Connection metadata: name: my-connection-resource spec: host: s3.example.com port: 4242 Then the bucket, which references the connection: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Bucket metadata: name: my-bucket-resource spec: bucketName: my-example-bucket connection: reference: my-connection-resource You can then use this bucket, for example in Druid, as a deep storage: apiVersion: druid.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: DruidCluster metadata: name: my-druid-cluster spec: deepStorage: s3: reference: my-bucket-resource # more spec here ... No matter if a connection is specified inline or as a separate object, the credentials are always specified in the same way. You will need a Secret containing the access key ID and secret access key, a SecretClass and then a reference to this SecretClass where you want to specify the credentials. The Secret: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: s3-credentials labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: s3-credentials-class (1) stringData: accessKey: YOUR_VALID_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE secretKey: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_THAT_BELONGS_TO_THE_KEY_ID_HERE 1 This label connects the Secret to the SecretClass.

This ConfigMap has the same name as the product instance and contains information about how to connect to the instance. The ConfigMap is used by other Operators to connect products together and can also be used by you, the user, to connect external software to Stackable-operated software. Products on the Stackable platform can, and in some cases must be connected with each other to run correctly. Some products are fundamental to the platform while others depend on them. For example, a NiFi cluster requires a ZooKeeper connection to run in distributed mode. Other products can optionally be connected with each other for better data flow. For example Trino does not store the query data itself, instead it interfaces with other applications to get access to it. To connect NiFi to ZooKeeper, NiFi needs to know at which host and port it can find the ZooKeeper instance. However the exact address is not known in advance. To enable a connection from NiFi to ZooKeeper purely based on the name of the ZooKeeper cluster, the discovery ConfigMap is used. With the ConfigMap, the name of the ZooKeeper cluster is enough to know how to connect to it, the ConfigMap has the same name as the cluster and contains all the information needed to connect to the ZooKeeper cluster.

It is aware of the interfaces and connections that may be consumed by other products and it also knows all the details of the actual running processes. It then creates the discovery ConfigMap: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: simple-zk data: ZOOKEEPER: simple-zk-server-default-0.simple-zk-server-default.default.svc.cluster.local:2181,simple-zk-server-default-1.simple-zk-server-default.default.svc.cluster.local:2181 The information needed to connect can be a string like above, for example a JDBC connect string: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:12345. But a ConfigMap can also contain multiple configuration files which can then be mounted into a client Pod. This is the case for HDFS, where the core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml files are put into the discovery ConfigMap. The ConfigMap is used by Stackable operators to connect products together, but can also be used by the user to retrieve connection information to connect to product instances. The operators consume only the ConfigMap, so it is also possible to create a ConfigMap by hand for a product instance that is not operated by a Stackable operator. These different usage scenarios are explained below. Stackable operators use the discovery ConfigMap to automatically connect to service dependencies. Hbase requires HDFS to run. With an HdfsCluster named simple-hdfs defined as such: apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HdfsCluster metadata: name: simple-hdfs spec: ... The HDFS instance is referenced to by name in HBase cluster spec in the field hdfsConfigMapName: apiVersion: hbase.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HbaseCluster metadata: name: simple-hbase spec: hdfsConfigMapName: simple-hdfs ... This is a common pattern across the platform. For example the DruidCluster spec contains a field zookeeperConfigMapName and the TrinoCluster spec contains a field hiveConfigMapName to connect Druid to ZooKeeper and Trino to Hive respectively. You can connect your own products to Stackable-operated product instances. How exactly you do this depends heavily on the application you want to connect. In general, use the name of the product instance to retrieve the ConfigMap and use the information in there to connect your own service. You can find links to these documentation pages below in the Further reading section. It is not uncommon to already have some core software running in your stack, such as HDFS. If you want to use HBase with the Stackable operator, you can still connect your already existing HDFS instance. You will have to create the discovery ConfigMap for your already existing HDFS yourself. Looking at the discovery documentation for HDFS, you can see that the discovery ConfigMap for HDFS contains the core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml files. The ConfigMap should look something like this: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: my-already-exisiting-hdfs data: core-site.xml: | hdfs-site.xml: | In your HBase cluster spec that you use with the Stackable HBase Operator, you can then reference my-already-existing-hdfs and the Stackable HBase Operator will use your manually created ConfigMap to configure HBase to use your HDFS instance: apiVersion: hbase.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HbaseCluster metadata: name: simple-hbase spec: hdfsConfigMapName: my-already-exisiting-hdfs ...

This document will show you the steps needed to contribute to the Stackable Platform. Contributions can come in many shapes and forms but in this document we’ll focus on code and documentation improvements. We’ll assume you already know what the Stackable Platform is and have a specific issue that you want solved. This document aims at getting your contribution posted as soon as possible. The development of the Stackable Platform takes place on GitHub. On GitHub, each repository has its own issue tracker and since Stackable is a platform, there are several repositories where issues and pull-requests can be created. If you already have a good idea where the issue or pull-request belongs, then you can skip reading to the contribution steps below. Otherwise, you might want to a have a look at the Development Dashboard for hints. Contribution steps: Lookup if an existing issue already covers your problem Submit a new issue. If it is only a trivial change like fixing a typo then an issue is not necessary and a pull-request can be created directly. Submit a pull-request if you want. The necessary steps to successfully create an approvable pull-request are detailed in Steps to contribute. Respond to questions or feedback Improve your submission if necessary Closing your contribution Before submitting a new issue or pull-request, it’s always a good idea to check if the issue has already been discussed in the past and if there is a resolution for it. If that is the case, consider contributing to the existing issue by either adding new feedback or code. When creating a new issue please provide as much information as you consider relevant. Issues can be bug reports, feature requests and so on. The Stackable repositories provide templates to make it easier to submit high-quality issues. When submitting a pull-request, you might be interested in knowing about the necessary Development Environment. Please see the Development Dashboard page to get an overview of the most important Git repositories used by us. At the core of the Stackable Platform are Kubernetes operators used to install and manage various data products. Each operator has its own repository, and therefore its own issue tracker and build pipeline. Every operator repository contains: The operator’s source code One or more Custom Resource Definitions owned by the operator Helm chart to easily install the operator Documentation Dockerfile and related artifacts to generate the operator image See the Development Dashboard for a detailed overview. In order to contribute source code, you need an environment that is capable of running the following tools: Docker Kind Helm Kuttl Rust Python The documentation is written in AsciiDoc format and processed with Antora Almost all build scripts assume a Unix based environment (preferably Linux).

This document shows how to configure a Stackable operator and its managed product to query OPA to enforce policy-based access control. OPA is an open source, general purpose policy engine. It supports a high-level declarative language called Rego. Rego enables you to specify complex policies as code and transfer the decision-making processes from your software to OPA. We refer to policies written in Rego as Rego rules. The provided OPA REST API allows you to enforce policies within microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines and more. OPA accepts arbitrary structured input data (e.g. JSON) when running queries against the API (and your Rego rules), to decouple policy decision-making from policy enforcement. The combination of arbitrary input data and the Rego rules enable you to specify and enforce almost any kind of policies. You can define powerful policies for e.g. user access for database tables, schemas, columns etc. You can enforce local network traffic, access time periods and many more. See the OPA documentation for further examples. The Stackable Operator for OPA deploys OPA as a DaemonSet in Kubernetes. This ensures that every registered Node runs exactly one OPA instance. In order to reduce traffic and latency, deployed products querying OPA must use the local OPA provided on their respective Node. Furthermore, the Stackable Operator for OPA deploys a service discovery ConfigMap (see Service discovery implementation guidelines) to expose its service URL to other Stackable operators. These operators then are configured to use the service discovery ConfigMap to extract the required URL and configure their products and authorizers. Authorizers are plugins for products that allow authorization and access control. The ConfigMap has one data entry that points to the OPA ClusterIP service: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: {clustername} data: OPA: http://{clustername}.{rolegroup}.svc.cluster.local:8081/ In order for OPA to make policy decisions, Rego rules must be bundled and supplied. The Stackable Operator for OPA has its own controller to bundle policies and provide them to OPA. Polices can be provided via ConfigMaps: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: simple-product-rego labels: opa.stackable.tech/bundle: \"product\" data: product.rego: | package product allow { true } The OPA bundle controller creates a bundle.tar.gz file locally, bundling the content of every ConfigMap labeled with opa.stackable.tech/bundle (the label value can be arbitrary). This bundle is read and activated by OPA. You can query the allow rule provided in the example above via: http://{clustername}.{rolegroup}.svc.cluster.local:8081/data/v1/product/allow In order to configure another operator and its product to query OPA, the service discovery ConfigMap must be consumed. There are two ways that qualify as best practice, depending on the product you are configuring: Mounting the discovery ConfigMap Reading the discovery ConfigMap The operator-rs framework has a module called opa.rs that offers a predefined struct OpaConfig and several helper methods to extract the OPA URL from the service discovery ConfigMap. #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, Deserialize, JsonSchema, PartialEq, Serialize)] #[serde(rename_all = \"camelCase\")] pub struct OpaConfig { pub config_map_name: String, pub package: Option, } You can use that struct in the CRD of your operator to configure the OPA service discovery ConfigMap as well as the desired package name. The method full_document_url_from_config_map reads the service discovery ConfigMap provided by the Stackable operator for OPA and constructs the URL to configure the product or its authorizers (the plugins that talk to OPA). Usually OPA authorizers are configured with the URL to the OPA REST API, authentication / security and other properties like caching. This differs from authorizer to authorizer. The Stackable platform uses internal (written by us) and external authorizers to configure the products. Here are some examples that may help you if you need to write an authorizer on your own: Trino Druid Apache Kafka","title":"OPA connection implementation guidelines","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"opa_configuration","url":"/home/stable/contributor/opa_configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"What is OPA?","hash":"_what_is_opa","id":2},{"text":"Examples for OPA policies","hash":"_examples_for_opa_policies","id":3},{"text":"Stackable Operator for OPA","hash":"_stackable_operator_for_opa","id":4},{"text":"Service Discovery","hash":"_service_discovery","id":5},{"text":"Provide Rego rules","hash":"_provide_rego_rules","id":6},{"text":"Consume the discovery ConfigMap","hash":"_consume_the_discovery_configmap","id":7},{"text":"Configure OPA access in the operator","hash":"_configure_opa_access_in_the_operator","id":8},{"text":"Authorizers","hash":"_authorizers","id":9},{"text":"Internal","hash":"_internal","id":10},{"text":"External","hash":"_external","id":11}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"For a conceptual overview of service discovery, consult the service discovery concept page. The question about which interfaces to expose varies from product to product and must be decided on an individual basis. However, as far as possible the exposed services should be reachable via Kubernetes services like ClusterIP or NodePort. The operator that discovers a service has two options for retrieving the information and providing it into the pods: Mount the discovery ConfigMap into the Pod directly as an environment variable. This can be used for products supporting setting values via CLI or can work with environment variables in their respective configuration files. Read the discovery ConfigMap and provide its content via the usual product configuration ConfigMap. This is in general a cleaner way if the product does not support setting values via CLI or environment variables in the configuration files because it avoids writing shell scripts to override the values manually. The following section offers some Rust code snippets to get an idea on how to create or retrieve the information in the discovery ConfigMap. As a convention, the name of that discovery ConfigMap is the name of the cluster. A deployed Stackable ZooKeeper cluster named simple-zk in namespace production will deploy a discovery ConfigMap production/simple-zk. Remember, per convention the discovery ConfigMap name of a cluster must be equal to the cluster name. The following code demonstrates how to create a discovery ConfigMap using the ConfigMapBuilder of the operator-rs framework: use stackable_operator::builder::{ConfigMapBuilder, ObjectMetaBuilder}; let cm = ConfigMapBuilder::new() .metadata( ObjectMetaBuilder::new() .name_and_namespace(my_cluster) .ownerreference_from_resource(my_cluster, None, Some(true))? .build()?, ) .add_data(\"CONNECT_STRING\", \"http://localhost:12345\") .build(); Given a discovery ConfigMap: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: my-config-map-name namespace: production data: CONNECT_STRING: \"http://localhost:12345\" This is a method to retrieve an EnvVar from a ConfigMap: use stackable_operator::k8s_openapi::api::{ core::v1::{ ConfigMapKeySelector, EnvVar, EnvVarSource, }, }; fn env_var_from_cm(name: &str, configmap_name: &str) -> EnvVar { EnvVar { name: name.to_string(), value_from: Some(EnvVarSource { config_map_key_ref: Some(ConfigMapKeySelector { name: Some(configmap_name.to_string()), key: name.to_string(), ..ConfigMapKeySelector::default() }), ..EnvVarSource::default() }), ..EnvVar::default() } } The returned EnvVar then can be added to a Pod container and used in the command or args field using the operator-rs framework container builder: use stackable_operator::builder::ContainerBuilder; let container = ContainerBuilder::new(\"my-container\") .command(vec![\"/bin/bash\".to_string(), \"-c\".to_string()]) .args(vec![\"./do_magic\", \"--with-env-var\", \"${CONNECT_STRING}\"]) .add_env_var(env_var_from_cm(\"CONNECT_STRING\", \"my-config-map-name\")) .build(); This is a method to read one entry of a discovery ConfigMap from an operator: use stackable_operator::{ client::Client, error::OperatorResult, k8s_openapi::api::core::v1::ConfigMap, }; async fn entry_from_cm( client: &Client, name: &str, namespace: Option, entry: &str, ) -> OperatorResult { Ok(client .get::(name, namespace) .await? .data .and_then(|mut data| data.remove(entry)) .unwrap()) } let connection_string = entry_from_cm(client, \"my-config-map-name\", Some(\"production\"), \"CONNECT_STRING\").await?; The retrieved connection string can be used to configure the product to connect to the discovered service. Currently, there is not much support from the operator-rs framework to assist with service discovery. The related code is mostly contained in each operator and similar to the examples above. The following list should indicate support for certain products or helper methods: ConfigMapBuilder in combination with ObjectMetaBuilder assists with building the discovery ConfigMap OPA: The operator-rs framework has a module called opa.rs that supports the creation of the data API connection string","title":"Service discovery implementation guidelines","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"service_discovery","url":"/home/stable/contributor/service_discovery.html","titles":[{"text":"Best practices","hash":"_best_practices","id":1},{"text":"Exposing config maps for service discovery","hash":"_exposing_config_maps_for_service_discovery","id":2},{"text":"Consuming config maps for service discovery","hash":"_consuming_config_maps_for_service_discovery","id":3},{"text":"Implementation details","hash":"_implementation_details","id":4},{"text":"Create a discovery ConfigMap","hash":"_create_a_discovery_configmap","id":5},{"text":"Consume a discovery ConfigMap","hash":"_consume_a_discovery_configmap","id":6},{"text":"Mounting the discovery ConfigMap","hash":"_mounting_the_discovery_configmap","id":7},{"text":"Reading the discovery ConfigMap","hash":"_reading_the_discovery_configmap","id":8},{"text":"Existing libraries","hash":"_existing_libraries","id":9}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"This guide covers the steps for internal and external contributors. Differences will be outlined. Depending on the project, not all steps make sense. For instance, if the documentation was changed then the integration tests need not to be adapted. Please skip the steps which are not applicable. As an external contributor, please fork the according repository on GitHub. Clone the repository to the local machine or if it is already cloned then make sure to pull the latest changes. Backports to previous releases are not covered in this guide. Create a feature branch. As for now, there is no naming convention. Make your desired changes in the according repository and test them manually. Ensure that the code compiles without warnings (cargo clippy --all-targets) and that the code is formatted with cargo fmt. If code was added or adapted then please create or adapt the unit tests in the same file as well as the integration tests in the tests directory. Ensure that all unit tests run successfully (cargo test) and all integration tests run successfully (./scripts/run_tests.sh). See also Changes in the integration tests. Comment your code and check with cargo doc --document-private-items that there are no syntax errors. The YAML schemas of the custom resource definitions (CRDs) are rebuilt when the project is compiled (see rust/operator-binary/build.rs if changing an operator). These CRDs as well as the product configuration are also required in the Helm chart and the Kubernetes manifest. To ensure that everything is in a consistent state, please execute make regenerate-charts. If it is useful for the users of the project to know about the change then it must be added to the changelog. For instance, if only the dependencies in an operator are upgraded but nothing changes for the user then the upgrade should not be added to the changelog. Conversely, if the dependencies in the operator framework are upgraded then changes are probably required in the operators (which are the clients of the framework) and therefore the upgrade must be mentioned in the changelog. The changelog must be formatted according to keep a changelog. The code for building the product images can be found in the docker-images repository. Please follow the steps in Preparation. Make the desired changes. Add an entry to the product image changelog and use the pattern -stackable to reference the next image version. The follows semantic versioning and is independent of the upstream version. If a new version of a product was added then the following tasks must be performed: Add the new version to the supported ones in the documentation of the operators (see docs/modules/ROOT/partials/supported-versions.adoc in the operator repositories). Update the operator to support the new version if necessary. Update the examples in the operator to use the new version. Update the integration tests. The tests should cover the latest patch version of each supported versions. Run the integration tests with the new product image. The image can be built and uploaded to the kind cluster with the following commands: ./build_product_images.py --product --image_version kind load docker-image --name=integration-tests See the output of build_product_images.py to retrieve the image tag for . Most code changes should also be tested with integration tests. The tests for every operator can be found in the operator repository in the tests directory. Follow the steps in Preparation for the integration tests as well. Create or adapt the tests. Try to mimic the style of the other tests. They are written with KUTTL and using a jinja2 templating mechanism to test multiple product versions at once. Start a test cluster with the create_test_cluster.py script. Its usage is described in the README.md file. If changes in an operator are tested then the according version of the operator must be started. If already another version was started by the test cluster script then it must be terminated. The operator can be started outside the cluster with cargo run — crd | kubectl apply -f - && cargo run — run. This approach allows a fast test develop cycle but has the downside that the RBAC rules are not tested. So a proper Helm installation should be tested before creating a pull request. First a Docker image of the operator must be built locally and uploaded to the kind cluster and then the Helm chart must be installed. This can be achieved in the operator directory with the following commands: docker build --file docker/Dockerfile --tag docker.stackable.tech/stackable/:-nightly . kind load docker-image docker.stackable.tech/stackable/:-nightly --name=integration-tests helm install deploy/helm// Run the tests from the repository root with ./scripts/run_tests.sh. The Stackable Platform documentation can be found at https://docs.stackable.tech/. The documentation is built with Antora from the sources in the documentation repository and the docs directories in the operator repositories. Follow the steps in Preparation to be able to change the documentation. Make your changes. Build the documentation locally to ensure that the formatting is fine and all links are specified correctly. See the README.adoc file for further details and the Documentation style guide for style and formatting guidelines. Files which are common in all operators are handled and rolled out by the operator-templating. Follow the steps in Preparation to check out the repository. Make your changes. Test the changes locally. Create the directory work, clone all operators into this directory, and run the test.sh script. The changes can be examined with git status. When the pull request is later merged into the main branch then pull requests with these changes will be created automatically. Depending on the change, it makes sense to run the integration tests for all changed operators. If the tests are not run in this stage and if there is even just one integration test failing in the subsequentially generated pull requests then the operator-templating must be adapted which creates again pull requests for all operators. Changes in the GitHub workflow actions cannot be tested until finally merged. Finally, pull requests must be created for all adapted repositories. Have a look at the review checklist and ensure that all applicable points are fulfilled. Create a comprehensive description of the changes. Link the according issue to the pull request by using a keyword like \"Closes\". Add references to other pull requests, like the pull request in the integration-tests repository which contains test cases for the change in the operator pull request. Select a reviewer. Usually \"stackabletech/developers\" is a good choice. If you are an internal contributor then assign yourself to the issue. All pull requests must pass a quality gate before they can be merged. This gate consists of required and not strictly required checks which are performed by automated GitHub checks, as well as the mentioned checklist which is checked manually in the review. The number of checks seems to be overwhelming but in practice they can be quite easily fulfilled if following this guide. A properly set-up development environment (see Development Environment) makes it even easier because the most critical steps are performed automatically like showing Clippy warnings while developing and formatting the code. Have a look at the status of the checks after they are processed and fix them. The reviewdog checks are not mandatory and can be ignored if the according change was intentionally. For instance, if a Kubernetes secret was added to the examples of an operator then the detect-secrets steps could fail which is okay in this case. After the pull request is approved, it can be merged. Internal contributors merge them on their own. Pull request from external contributors are merged by the approver.","title":"Steps to contribute","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"steps","url":"/home/stable/contributor/steps.html","titles":[{"text":"Preparation","hash":"_preparation","id":1},{"text":"Changes in Rust projects","hash":"_changes_in_rust_projects","id":2},{"text":"Changes in the product images","hash":"_changes_in_the_product_images","id":3},{"text":"Changes in the integration tests","hash":"_changes_in_the_integration_tests","id":4},{"text":"Changes in the documentation","hash":"_changes_in_the_documentation","id":5},{"text":"Changes in the operator-templating","hash":"_changes_in_the_operator_templating","id":6},{"text":"Create pull requests","hash":"_create_pull_requests","id":7}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"This page provides guidelines on how to write documentation for the Stackable platform. Style guidelines specify things such as capitalization rules, which format to use for emphasis or how API objects and other components should be styled in the documentation - formatting and \"superficial\" aspects of text. Grammar, tone and voice guidelines make the documentation consistent across the pages and as clear as possible. These guidelines include using a conversational tone, using second person and active voice. For formatting text and code, follow the Kubernetes documentation style guide. The Stackable platform is built on Kubernetes and the documentation often refers to Kubernetes API objects, custom resources and snippets of resource specifications, as well as command line snippets to interact with Kubernetes clusters. The Kubernetes documentation style guide specifies how these terms and snippets should be formatted. Some examples: Use PascalCase for API objects such as ConfigMap or KafkaCluster Use italics to define or introduce new terms Use code style for filenames, directories and paths Use code style for object field names and namespaces Use normal style for string and integer field values For writing style, language, grammar and tone guidelines we refer to the Google developer documentation style guide.

These components are the orchestrator and the agents that manage bare-metal (or virtual) servers. During previous design discussions it became quite clear that a lot of the issues that we need to for these components are very similar to issues that Kubernetes faced in the past - and solved already. Some examples of this are: Agents need to register with the orchestrator in a secure way The orchestrator needs a mechanism for operators to subscribe to data In theory, Kubernetes components are extensible enough that it should allow us to implement our components in a way that we can deploy them on top of an existing Kubernetes. This would save us some work, as we’d for example not have to reimplement the registration process for agents. The image shows the two main options that we have identified during deliberations so far: shaded in red is the option of reusing Kubernetes components (please refer to Reuse kube-apiserver and kubelet for more details) shaded in green is the option of writing our own components (please refer to Start from Scratch for more details) Avoiding too tight coupling with Kubernetes development & community Deployment effort for potential customers Development effort Reuse kube-apiserver & kubelet Reuse kube-apiserver Start from Scratch Chosen option: \"Reuse only kube-apiserver\", because the amount of work to get a sufficient version of our orchestrator up and running is currently holding us back from achieving results that provide actual benefits to potential customers. While this increases our dependency on the Kubernetes project and potentially increases the deployment effort for customers a bit it has significant upsides as well. The main benefit is the fact that this will give as a battle-tested orchestrator right now, which we can use for our development. The Kubernetes api is very complex and reimplementing the pieces of the api-server that we need turned out to be more effort than expected. In the interest of reaching a MVP as early as possible we decided to push the final decision down the road a bit. This option is no decision for Kubernetes for good, but rather a decision for the first iteration of the product. By taking this step we are forcing ourselves to remain compatible with Kubernetes and keep the option open of implementing a limited version of the api-server later. Much less effort implementing the orchestrator at this time No need to deploy a full Kubernetes stack, we can easily just package an api-server as part of our deployment Relatively tight coupling with the kubernetes project Stackable needs to deploy a server-client architecture where the decentralized agent receives commands from the central server to execute these. In order to create an infrastructure like this, there are some functions that need to be in place. Some examples for these functions are: Deploy TLS keys and certificates to agents Register agents with orchestrator Monitor agents for liveness Communication between components Tagging and selection of executing nodes …​ Most of these functions would be considered boiler-plate and are not exclusive to our intended use-case. Kubernetes has implemented a lot of this functionality already and we could try to reuse this by deploying our components on top of an existing Kubernetes infrastructure. The general idea would not be to fork Kubernetes and just reuse the code for our purposes, but rather to deploy the orchestrator as for example an operator in a vanilla Kubernetes cluster and deploying CRDs for our necessary data structures. This way the operator could subscribe to our resources and publish the necessary downstream structures that Stackable operators would then listen to. Thinking the concept a bit further we might even get away without an orchestrator as most functionality is taken over by the Kube apiserver already. Good, because we do not need to reimplement existing functionality Bad, because we have to strictly adhere to Kubernetes structures for everything we do Bad, because we would need to marry our release cycles to the very short cycles of Kubernetes Bad, because for customers without an existing Kubernetes we would need to somehow provision a Kubernetes cluster Bad, because for some customers Kubernetes is not a technology that they want to invest in Bad, because we have to keep a very close eye on Kubernetes development to ensure we remain compatible with everything they do Since we aim to be api compatible with Kubernetes, we could use the api-server from Kubernetes as our central communications hub instead of a custom built orchestrator. As all components we plan to develop need to interface with this central server anyway this is an easy way of ensuring that we stay api-compatible every step of the way. Additionally this does not need a final decision, depending on how many Kubernetes features we end up using, it might still be an option at a later point in time to create our own apiserver in Rust und roll that out to customers who are not using Kubernetes. Good, because ops and dev-persons could keep using their existing Kubernetes tools and know-how Good, because we save the initial effort of implementing a api-compatible apiserver Good, because it is a reversible decision that allows us to gather speed at this time Bad, because it may tempt us to end up using more and more kube-apiserver functionality which would make it harder and harder to write our own implementation later Bad, because this forces us to use etcd as storage backend, we were originally planning to rather go with a sql database We implement the orchestrator and the agent from scratch, instead of reusing any Kubernetes code. By doing this we gain the flexibility of designing our data structures and APIs as we see fit as well as decoupling us from Kubernetes release cycles.

Most notably these tools are: Spark Kafka Some implementation effort may be avoided by reusing these operators instead of recreating the tool-specific functionality that is already implemented. Since these operators are designed to work with Kubernetes and thus exclusively focused on containers some translation of data structures and processes would be necessary. Keeping the implementation effort as low as realistically possible Keeping compatibility with Kubernetes as far as possible to ease a later move towards Kubernetes deployments Avoid hard dependencies on external projects that may force us to fork in case they break compatibility with us Allow reuse of Kubernetes operators (would need to be decided individually for every tool) Don’t reuse operators Chosen option: \"Don’t reuse operators\", because the core value proposition of Stackable is that customers can get all tools from one place. This sort of implies that everything looks, feels and behaves the same, which would be very tough to ensure when depending on external projects that all behave differently.

For every process a user wants to run in the cluster we need to find a node to run it on. Usually users have an opinion which nodes make good candidates and we need to support a syntax that is flexible enough that users can select the nodes they want to target. Our competition currently requires users to manually select all machines that software should be deployed to. Our goal is to be at least as good if not better. Problems We want to support multiple instances of a service (or role) on a single node. We have to be able to target single instances with one-shot commands (e.g. restart this process) We need to be able to place instances in a very flexible way but also in a very strict way Sometimes there is an agreed upon fixed placement of services to nodes that must be adhered to Have users specify a list of nodeNames in their resources This would be the scenario customers of current Big Data distributions are used to Reuse the \"Label and Selector\" syntax from Kubernetes See also Assigning Pods to Nodes We decided to go with the Kubernetes way of using label selectors. Example: leader: selectors: default: selector: matchLabels: component: spark matchExpressions: - { key: tier, operator: In, values: [ cache ] } - { key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [ dev ] } config: cores: 1 memory: \"1g\" instances: 3 instancesPerNode: 1 20core: selector: matchLabels: component: spark cores: 20 matchExpressions: - { key: tier, operator: In, values: [ cache ] } - { key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [ dev ] } config: cores: 10 memory: \"1g\" instances: 3 instancesPerNode: 2 config: Here we see that for a node type called leader we have an object with two top-level properties, one of them being selectors. selectors is again a map of names to objects. The names are chosen by the user and should describe the role group, often this will be just default or something similar but it allows overriding configuration per role group while inheriting parent-level config. In summary, we decided that all our CRDs should follow a consistent pattern: At the top level there is one property per role Under each role there can be one or more role groups (in a selectors property) Each role group has a single selector which is a Kubernetes LabelSelector Each role group can have optional instances and instancesPerNode fields This method also allows for (optional) auto-scaling should new nodes be added that match the selector. The details of how this can be implemented are not in scope for this ADR. We have a consistent behavior across all Operators It is better than what customers have today People already familiar with Kubernetes should feel right at home It is more effort to implement than the alternatives It is harder to use for everyone who’s not used to the Kubernetes style of selecting nodes The old way of listing hosts can be relatively easily emulated (but should be explained in the docs) \"Label and Selector\" syntax Assigning Pods to Nodes","title":"ADR009: Assigning Services to Nodes","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"ADR009-selector_support","url":"/home/stable/contributor/adr/ADR009-selector_support.html","titles":[{"text":"Context and Problem Statement","hash":"_context_and_problem_statement","id":1},{"text":"Considered Options","hash":"_considered_options","id":2},{"text":"Decision","hash":"_decision","id":3},{"text":"Positive Consequences","hash":"_positive_consequences","id":4},{"text":"Negative Consequences","hash":"_negative_consequences","id":5},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":6}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"Status: accepted Deciders: Lars Francke Date: 1.3.2021 Kubernetes follows a declarative model where a user describes the desired state of the world. There are some things that cannot be easily or naturally modeled in a declarative way. Some examples being: restart, start, stop, repair, finalize upgrade, etc. We still need to support those actions. This ADR is about finding a way to do so. As can be seen in the linked issue others are facing the same issue and various workarounds are in-use. Kubernetes offers no native way to achieve our goal. Have the Operators start a Web server that accepts requests for these actions Add CRDs for these kinds of actions Have a single CRD: FooCommand which takes a string with the command (e.g. \"restart\") Have a CRD per command (e.g. FooRestart, FooStart) We decided to go with a single CRD per command. We decided against a web server (for now) because it’d mean we’d need to reimplement authentication and authorization from scratch and this’d need to be consistent with the way Kubernetes works. Unfortunately, Kubernetes doesn’t support arbitrary subresources for CRDs yet (only scale and status are supported) Our implementation idea is as follows: Create a CRD It needs to have a reference to the parent resource (i.e. a name and a namespace) Write an operator (command operator) which should be made generic and reusable This operator watches this new custom resource For each command object it tries to find the referenced resource and sets the ownerReference of the command-CR to the one of the parent In theory users could do this themselves but it’s harder to use (i.e. having to find the uid) The parent controller will be notified and during its reconcile it can get a list of all commands sorted by creationTimestamp It can then work on the command - tracking progress in the status - and also potentially update the command-CR Open questions: Should the command CR be deleted immediately after it has been completed? Should the command CR be used to track progress in addition to or instead of the parent resource? We do not change the spec of the main objects so we can keep imperative actions out of it This allows users to keep the spec in version control Implementation effort because each CRD needs a new controller Can be mitigated somehow because the controllers should be pretty uniform Can be harder to use Instead of being able to issue a simple command like spark restart users first have to construct a proper YAML file and then use kubectl to apply it Can be mitigated with custom CLIs https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72637","title":"ADR010: Expressing one-shot commands in a Kubernetes-native way","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"ADR010-command_pattern","url":"/home/stable/contributor/adr/ADR010-command_pattern.html","titles":[{"text":"Context and Problem Statement","hash":"_context_and_problem_statement","id":1},{"text":"Considered Options","hash":"_considered_options","id":2},{"text":"Decision","hash":"_decision","id":3},{"text":"Positive Consequences","hash":"_positive_consequences","id":4},{"text":"Negative Consequences","hash":"_negative_consequences","id":5},{"text":"Links","hash":"_links","id":6}]},"34":{"id":34,"text":"Status: accepted Deciders: Sönke Liebau Lars Francke Date: 17.03.2021 To run the Stackable platforms some components will need to be installed on the managed servers. We will offer OS packages for a specified set of distributions, currently deb and RPM packages are available. To make the components behave the same regardless of the target platform, we would like to agree on some default directories and what content we will put there. This ADR is less to document alternative solutions, but rather to document the directory structure we agreed on, hence there are no alternative options discussed. Instead, I have added excerpts from the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard to illustrate why I think the chosen paths are the correct ones. Follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and keep files under /etc/opt and /var/opt Deviate from the Standard and remove the extra opt subdirectory Predictability for users Adherence to standards & best-practices We decided to deviate from what the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard specifies, in order to make the file location more familiar to our users. Please refer to the listing below for final locations. While the standard calls for variable data and config files to be located in opt subdirectories under /var and /etc we have never seen this actually being done in practice and would expect our users to be confused if they had to look for the files here. Config files should be easily located for the largest part of our users Strictly speaking we break the official requirements of where our config files should be - but we seem to be in good company, as no one really follows this recommendation anyway / ├── etc │ └── stackable │ ├── agent │ │ └── secure │ ├── serviceconfig │ └── zookeeper-operator ├── opt │ └── stackable │ ├── agent │ ├── packages │ └── zookeeper-operator └── var ├── lib │ └── stackable │ └── agent └── log └── stackable └── servicelogs ├── namespace-product-name └── namespace-product-name In accordance with Filesystem Hierarchy Standard # 3.13.1 we will install the binaries for our components under `/opt/stackable//binaryfile. In the example above there are subdirectories for the agent and the ZooKeeper operator which contain the executable files for these components. For worker servers which are under management by our agent, we will need to install packages that contain the upstream software that is being rolled out by the agent. As this is also third party software but being used by Stackable we will install these under /opt/stackable/' as well, but put them under a subdirectory `packages to keep them separate from the Stackable software. This only refers to the default setting the agent is configured with though, this path can be freely chosen by the user. According to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard # 3.7.4, if our binaries are kept under /opt we should keep the associated config files in /etc/opt and replicate the same folder structure here that can be found in /opt. This default location seems like it is different from the industry standard, as we could not find any software that actually uses this path. Instead it is accepted best-practice to put configuration either directly under /etc or create a vendor subdirectory under /etc and keep configs there. According to the standard, config files that are written for the actual services that are managed by Stackable (Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, …​) should also reside in /etc/opt/stackable. Following the logic stated above, we will divert from the standard and remove the opt from this path as well. It doesn’t make sense to call the containing directory packages, like the parent directory for the binaries, so instead we have renamed it to serviceconfig to better express what it actually contains. For components that need working directories for variable / changing data on disk, the standard specifies that these should reside under /var/opt/ and then again replicate the folder structure that exists under /opt/. Like for config files we will deviate from the standard here and follow common practice instead. Any component that needs a working directory should keep this in a subdirectory under /var/lib/stackable/. Stackable components that have been installed from OS packages write their logs directly to the systemd journal. These need not have a log directory on disk by default. For the services that are managed by Stackable, log directories will be kept in per-service subdirectories under /var/log/stackable/servicelogs. This can be configured in the agent and is just the default value. The actual log directory for services that are rolled out on nodes managed by Stackable can be controlled by the user. If users prefer to keep their logs in /var/log/hadoop for example then this can easily be overridden when creating the cluster.","title":"ADR011: Directory Structure Used by Stackable Components on Managed Hosts","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"ADR011-directory_structure","url":"/home/stable/contributor/adr/ADR011-directory_structure.html","titles":[{"text":"Context and Problem Statement","hash":"_context_and_problem_statement","id":1},{"text":"Considered Options","hash":"_considered_options","id":2},{"text":"Decision Drivers","hash":"_decision_drivers","id":3},{"text":"Decision","hash":"_decision","id":4},{"text":"Benefits:","hash":"_benefits","id":5},{"text":"Drawbacks:","hash":"_drawbacks","id":6},{"text":"Discussion of Options","hash":"_discussion_of_options","id":7},{"text":"Binaries for Stackable Components","hash":"_binaries_for_stackable_components","id":8},{"text":"Packages","hash":"_packages","id":9},{"text":"Configuration Files for Stackable Components","hash":"_configuration_files_for_stackable_components","id":10},{"text":"Service Configuration","hash":"_service_configuration","id":11},{"text":"Working Directories","hash":"_working_directories","id":12},{"text":"Log File","hash":"_log_file","id":13}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"Status: accepted Deciders: Teo Klestrup Röijezon Lars Francke Sönke Liebau Date: 2021-11-23 Technical Story: https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/4 Services need a way to authenticate each other when communicating. This is typically done by issuing each service some form of secret token that the counterparty can validate. Depending on the service in question, this may be a token unique to the counterparty (such as a password or API key) or a token accepted by a whole trust domain (such as a Kerberos keytab or a TLS certificate). This ADR primarily concerns itself with the latter case. Depending on the specifics of the service being communicated with, this token may need to identify the replica (Pod in Kubernetes terms), the set of replicas (RoleGroup, StatefulSet, or Pod), or the server that the replica is running on (Node). Depending on the specific service being communicated with, the token may need to identify the the replica (Pod in Kubernetes terms), the set of replicas (RoleGroup, StatefulSet, or Pod), or the server that the replica is running on (Node) Some customers have an existing trust domain where they provision us static tokens that we must use Many customers do not have an existing trust domain, nor do they want to take on the operational burden of managing it manually Ideally, automatically provisioned tokens should be as short-lived as is practical Kubernetes secrets (+ Cert Manager etc) Hashicorp Vault Custom secret service Option 3: Custom Secret Service Secrets are managed in Kubernetes Secret objects, which are mounted into the Pods.

Security fixes might come in between. Different Kubernetes components (including kubectl) will only support a limited number of versions, as mandated by kubernetes' Version Skew Policy. Therefore, we need to define the supported Kubernetes versions. The API overview provides an overview of the Kubernetes Deprecation Policy. In there, we find rules that can guide our decisions. \"Rule #4a: minimum API lifetime is determined by the API stability level\" \"Alpha API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice\" \"Beta API versions must be supported for 9 months or 3 releases (whichever is longer) after deprecation\" \"GA API versions may be marked as deprecated, but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes\" \"Rule #7: Deprecated behaviors must function for no less than 1 year after their announced deprecation.\" This means that a codebase relying on alpha features can only reliably be developed against a single kubernetes version. For beta features, 3 kubernetes versions can be covered with the same codebase. The linked document also shows the overlapping of versions. When a feature matures from beta into stable, the beta version can still be used for 3 releases. After that, the stable version has to be used. For actually deprecated features (not just moved from beta to stable), the grace period is also more than three releases; as specified a deprecated feature has to be supported for at least a year. The stackable operators depend on a specific kubernetes version through the operator framework. At the moment we do not have an explicit version compatibility, and the software will work with different versions of the objects we use are the same in different kubernetes versions (i.e. an operator uses 1.21 but all resource definitions we rely on are identical in 1.20 so the operator works in 1.20 too). Kubernetes maintains release branches for the most recent three minor releases. Any minor version for 1.19 onwards receives one year of patch support. Most providers of managed kubernetes refer to this schedule when defining their own support windows. See https://kubernetes.io/releases/ and https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/ AKS supports three kubernetes versions, where they seem to try to make these the three latest versions. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#kubernetes-version-support-policy Each minor version is supported for approximately twelve months after it’s first released. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html Google provides a total of 14 months of support for each GKE minor version once the version has been made available in the Regular channel. […​] After 12 months, a supported version will enter a 2-month maintenance period before reaching end of life. See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning IONOS seems to support the latest three versions; as of January 2022 the supported versions are 1.20, 1.21 and 1.22. As of September 2021, the supported OpenShift Container Platforms are 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 which in turn use Kubernetes v1.19, v1.20, and v1.21. see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-about-this-release see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/release_notes/ocp-4-7-release-notes.html#ocp-4-7-about-this-release see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/release_notes/ocp-4-8-release-notes.html#ocp-4-8-about-this-release Some customers told us they have troubles keeping the pace at which Kubernetes moves. They are only slowly adopting new Kubernetes releases, or even refrain completely from using Kubernetes. Customers might even be lagging behind in their Kubernetes clusters. This means that too fast a pace is not good for customers. Tech is fast moving: major Kubernetes improvements are released multiple times a year. This means that we need to stay up to date, supporting versions that are not supported by the kubernetes project is potentially difficult. Managed Kubernetes offerings (GKE & Co.) typically only support fairly recent k8s releases. We should be able to run on all large managed kubernetes services. How can we upgrade the Kubernetes we run without customer intervention? follow Kubernetes support timeline/version skew policy needs an outline of migration strategy, announcements, communications and paths support any Kubernetes Version for n months needs an outline of migration strategy identify Stackable’s own long-term-support version of Kubernetes outline additional effort, like handling of security patches, and how to deal with missing new mainstream features It was decided that we will support the latest three kubernetes versions. Kubernetes release cycle is approximately 15 weeks, which means we support each version for 45 weeks or a little over 10 months. According to the deprecation policy this means that we will have a single API version for every object across all 3 versions available, so we will be able to compile a single binary that works with all 3 versions of kubernetes. In general, having to support less means we can focus more on building new features instead of maintaining compatibility over a large range of kubernetes versions. This speed might be too fast for some users.

This requires a high degree of composability where one component refers to another compenent in its definition. While this is a simple concept in principle it requires that operators obtain information about the object that is referred to and inject this information into the configuration of the object that refers to it. An example for this is a NiFi cluster definition referring to a ZooKeeper cluster definition via a znode name: apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: NifiCluster metadata: name: simple-nifi spec: zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode For this example the NiFi operator needs to somehow insert the content of this config map into specific NiFi config files. This ADR is about the preferred way of implementing dependencies like described above. Option 1: Inserting ConfigMap/Secret content into target config in the operator Option 2: Mounting ConfigMap/Secret into the pods Chosen option: \"Option 2\", because it makes better use of Kubernetes features to model dependencies between definitions which in turn will make restart implementations and general debugging easier and more predictable. This decision will not hold true for all possible scenarios, but should be understood more as a implementation guideline: If a pod needs to access the content of a ConfigMap or Secret it should do this by mounting the ConfigMap/Secret unless there is a good reason to access the ConfigMap directly in the operator instead. Dependencies will be clearly modelled in Kubernetes by mounts, which makes behavior of the entire architecture more predictable Operators need to implement a much simpler logic around watches, as triggering reconciliations is handled via k8s dependencies (mounts) Complexity is moved from the operator code into init containers that need to perform insertion of the ConfigMap/Secret content into actual config files Debugging a running configuration becomes harder in cases where users have no access to a shell in the pods, as this would be the only way to actually see the running configuration (#210 has been created to investigate mitigating this) The operator can retrieve the content from ConfigMaps/Secrets during reconciliation and insert the values directly into the target config. The target config would then be written either to a ConfigMap or a Secret, depending on whether sensitive input data is contained in it. Good, because it isolates most of the complexity in the operator Good, because it would allow referencing ConfigMaps and Secrets in different namespaces which would potentially allow for less duplication Good, because it gives an almost complete manifestation of a running config in k8s objects that can be used for debugging Bad, because it would allow referencing ConfigMaps and Secrets in different namespaces, which would dilute namespace separation Bad, because it makes debugging startup issues of products much harder, as pods will simply not appear if required ConfigMaps are missing, effectively bypassing well established k8s patterns (like a pod missing a mount not starting and writing events about why it is not starting) Bad, because the dependencies between pods and configmaps / secrets become very complex and hard to debug as they are not modelled in any way as k8s dependencies (mounts) Bad, because setting up the correct watches in the operator becomes very complex, with a likelyhood of inadvertently forgetting to add a new watch that becomes necessary as CRDs evolve Bad, because it potentially propagates sensitive values to multiple places by copying secret content to additional places Bad, because the Operator is seeing the Secrets. This is not a problem now, but if we could avoid it that would be better Instead of accessing the content of ConfigMaps/Secrets in the operator, the operator would simply mount these object into the generated pods. Accessing the content of these mounted objects would then need to be done in an init container, currently this is done with shell commands, but this would be replaced with a more suitable tool in a follow-up ADR. Good, because mounting the ConfigMap/Secret directly into the pod allows the restart controller to automatically restart a Pod if a mounted object changes. Otherwise, changes would not be propagated or the Operator would have to watch the ConfigMap/Secret for changes itself. The watching/restarting is done once by Kubernetes + the restart controller and makes our Operators simpler Bad, because the mounted properties cannot be validated by the Operator. Although Kubernetes at least verifies that all the properties that should be mounted exist Bad, because it is more difficult to see which config is actually used to run the product, as the actual config is only finally assembled inside of the container","title":"ADR015: How Should Operators Use Values from ConfigMaps & Secrets","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"ADR015-using_values_from_configmaps","url":"/home/stable/contributor/adr/ADR015-using_values_from_configmaps.html","titles":[{"text":"Context and Problem Statement","hash":"_context_and_problem_statement","id":1},{"text":"Considered Options","hash":"_considered_options","id":2},{"text":"Decision Outcome","hash":"_decision_outcome","id":3},{"text":"Positive Consequences","hash":"_positive_consequences","id":4},{"text":"Negative Consequences","hash":"_negative_consequences","id":5},{"text":"Pros and Cons of the Options","hash":"_pros_and_cons_of_the_options","id":6},{"text":"Option 1 - Inserting ConfigMap/Secret content into target config in the operator","hash":"option1","id":7},{"text":"Option 2 - Mounting ConfigMap/Secret into the pods","hash":"option2","id":8}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"Status: accepted Deciders: Felix Hennig Sebastian Bernauer Siegfried Weber Sönke Liebau Teo Klestrup Röijezon Date: 29.04.2022 Currently we do not have a common schema of how we refer to S3 buckets that are used by the managed product. For example Trino, Druid and Hive all require/support specifying one or more S3 buckets to access, for some of the tools these buckets can reside on separate S3 endpoints (AWS, MinIO, Ceph, …​). We want to define a shared set of CRDs which can be used to specify these connections in an easy and composable fashion and works the same for all products across the Stackable Data Platform. Must allow using multiple S3 endpoints in the same environment Must support buckets with generated names that are not known up front (like with Rook’s object bucket claim pattern) Must allow specifying just an S3 backend without a bucket (for example Trino and Druid need this) Should be easy to use for the end-user and not require scripting or similar things to take care of repetitively specifying the same S3 endpoint for multiple buckets (or comparable issues) Should favor native K8s mechanisms like ownership and reconciliation notifications over custom logic Must not put extra effort on the user in order to be easier to implement Option 1: Isolating S3 endpoint details in an S3Connection object and credentials in the S3Bucket Option 2: Inlining S3 endpoint details in the S3Bucket object Option 3: Inlining bucket name and credentials in the product configuration Option 4: Isolating S3 endpoint details and credentials in an S3Connection object Option 5: Merge of options 1, 3 & 4 Option 6: Generate inlined S3Connection objects from templates with a dedicated controller Option 7: Use the ConfigMap format that has been defined by Rook for use with its object bucket claim method Chosen option: \"Option 5\" with caveats, because it allows us to start with a simple implementation that works for now, but can be gradually expanded to include more complex cases over time. We will in step 1 implement only the inlined version of the S3Bucket object like this: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: S3Bucket metadata: name: my-bucket data: bucketName: my-bucket-123 secretClass: minio-credentials s3Connection: inline: host: test-minio port: 9000 tls: verification: server: caCert: secretClass: my-s3-ca Implementing this gives us a working solution and buys time to evaluate options for implementing more complex functionality. A required decision that was more or less orthogonal to the main decision documented in this ADR was to make all objects discussed in this ADR namespaced instead of cluster scoped, as this is in line with the overall approach of allowing namespace isolation for Stackable infrastructures. We will spike the second half of option 5> as well as , port: Option, //... credentials: Option, } struct S3Bucket { connection: Option, bucket_name: Option, } enum S3ConnectionReference { inline { host: Option, port: Option, }, external { referencename: Option, // refers to the name of an S3Connection object } } struct S3Credentials { //... } pub fn resolve_s3_bucket(bucket: &S3Bucket) -> Result { if let Some(conn) = bucket.connection { Ok(match conn { S3ConnectionReference::inline { conn } => conn , S3ConnectionReference::external { conn } => { // Create s3 bucket with inlined connection and return conn.inline_connection() } }) } Ok(()) } Good, because it gives a lot of flexibility in defining S3 buckets, it pretty much has all the benefits of options 1, 3 & 4 Good, because we can start implementing only the inline configuration so that the operators only have to watch a single object (similar to option 2). Later on the reference mechanism can be added without a breaking change (as an addition to the complex enum). Bad, because setting up all necessary watches in the operator to ensure objects are reconciled as needed will become extremely complex This option solves the issue of unnecessarily repeating S3 endpoint details in every S3Bucket object by adding a controller that generates S3Buckets from templates that allow defining S3Connection templates in bulk. By offering a default way of generating multiple S3Buckets from a single object we try to preempt users from creating tooling of their own for generating these types of objects. Good, because it makes watches easy-ish to set up in the operators (identical to option 2) Bad, because it requires creating a template object per set of credentials that are to be used for accessing the S3 endpoint There is an existing format for specifying object buckets in ConfigMaps that has been defined by RedHat (or maybe just documented and defined by someone else). Adhering to this format would have the benefit of automatically being compatible with any external system that uses this standard. This option can be considered roughly equivalent to Option2, as the content of the ConfigMap matches what is specified in the S3Connection object for that option.

In theory, a given Operator version depends on some SemVer range of image_version (for example ^1.3.0, which expands to >=1.3.0 =N.0.0 <N+1.0.0), depending on the -stackable$IMAGE_SEMVER_MAJOR tag. This works OK for spinning up new clusters, but means that existing clusters may keep running old image versions even after upgrading to new (incompatible) Operator versions. The cluster may also end up in a mixed environment if a replica gets deployed to a new node after a new image version has been released. One case where this matters is when adding new features (such as preinstalling new libraries) to a product image that the operator then depends on. This isn’t a breaking change for the product image, since it still works for old operator versions, which can simply ignore the new feature. There is an argument that It could be considered a breaking change for the operator (though internal dependency upgrades are typically not considered breaking), but this would not help selecting the correct product image anyway. Based on the above, there are actually two decisions to take around this problem: How are stackable image versions created? How does the operator decide which image to use? While these two questions are related to each other they can be decided fairly independently of each other. The decision process for 2. will be influenced by the decision that is taken on 1., so we will get this done first. This ADR will be limited to the question of how stackable image versions are created, with the question of how the operator derives the correct image to use deferred to a subsequent ADR. Old versions of operators must keep working and deploying images that they are compatible with We should try to limit the number of maintained image version \"tracks\" for each product It should not be necessary to update the used operator version in order to be able to deploy a new product version The chosen option should make life as easy as possible for the end-user, it doesn’t need to be the simplest one to implement There are two main options that were considered, both of which can be implemented in two variants: For these variants it is assumed that tags which mark a release in the docker images repository (regardless of whether this is a shared repo or a dedicated repo) will contain only the stackable image version. This means that the definitions of packaged product versions are included in this tag. For example, if a stackable image version 0.1.0 is released at a time when the latest product version is 3.1.0 then there will never be an image version 0.1.0 for product version 3.1.1. The tag 0.1.0 will point at a specific commit in the repository and this commit will also include all Dockerfiles used to build the product images, so up to product version 3.1.0. If a Dockerfile for product version 3.1.1 is later created it would not be included in this tag, and could only be released by creating a tag 0.1.1. The tags for this variant would look like this: 0.1.0 0.1.1 0.2.0 For these variants the release tag will also contain the product version in addition to the image version, so for the combination mentioned above (stackable image version 0.1.0 and product version 3.1.0) the following tag would be created: 3.1.0-stackable0.1.0 This would allow us to release later versions of the product without having to change to stackable image version - i.e. without needlessly releasing practically unchanged images. The main options that are to be considered in this ADR are: Each operator version hard-codes exactly one image version that it supports, and we release new product images for each operator images. The operator version will be kept separate from the stackable image version, for the image version we use semver. With these two dimensions described, we end up with the following list of options to be considered for this ADR: Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions - Variant 1 Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions - Variant 2 Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 1 Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 2 The following table shows the image versions resulting for all four options based on the following scenario: Product Versions Available Operator Versions Available 2.8.0 2.9.0 0.1.0 0.1.1 0.2.0 Please note, that this refers to the operator versions that were needed based on semver rules. Some of the options in the table below may contain operator versions not listed here, because it was necessary to release the operator itself in a new version in order to make a new product version available. For this scenario, no change to the image itself was assumed to be needed. Option Image Version 1 - Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions - Variant 1 2.8.0-stackable0.1.0 2.8.0-stackable0.2.0 2.8.0-stackable0.1.1 2.8.0-stackable0.1.2 2.9.0-stackable0.1.2 2.8.0-stackable0.2.1 2.9.0-stackable0.2.1 2 - Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions - Variant 2 2.8.0-stackable0.1.0 2.8.0-stackable0.2.0 2.8.0-stackable0.1.1 2.9.0-stackable0.1.0 2.9.0-stackable0.2.0 2.9.0-stackable0.1.1 3 - Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 1 2.8.0-stackable0.1.0 2.8.0-stackable0.1.1 2.9.0-stackable0.1.1 4 - Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 2 2.8.0-stackable0.1.0 2.9.0-stackable0.1.0 We chose option 4 (Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 2), so the resulting tags will look like shown in the table below. The difference is due to the fact that docker images already contain the product name and we do not need to repeat this in the tag, whereas the docker images repository contains multiple products. Git Tag Docker Registry Tag kafka2.8.0_stackable0.1.0 2.8.0_stackable0.1.0 kafka2.9.0_stackable0.1.0 2.9.0_stackable0.1.0 kafka2.9.0_stackable0.1.1 2.9.0_stackable0.1.1 A subsequent ADR will contain follow up decisions on how much of the selection process for the correct image we want to automate in the operators. Initially no automation will be implemented, users need to select a working product version and image version combination and refer to the fully qualified version from the CRD (i.e. docker registry tag from the table above). There must be a compatibility matrix for the operator and product versions. This matrix should probably contain at least the following states: \"compatible\" (which means tested and supported by Stackable), \"unsupported\" (which means there is no known technical restriction which prevents you from using it but it is either not tested or contains vulnerabilities), and \"incompatible\" (which means there were breaking changes and this combination will not work). This compatibility matrix should not be hard-coded into the operators because then a new release of an operator is required every time a new product version should be supported by this operator. Instead it should be read from a config map. The main reasons for picking this option were: it allows us to decouple operator version and image version to a high degree there is no need to build unneeded images just to accommodate changes in other components (operator change vs image change) it keeps the option to provide automation around selecting the correct image version later on without the need for breaking changes Image versions are only comparable when combined with the product version. Image version 0.1.0 in kafka2.8.0_stackable0.1.0 and kafka2.9.0_stackable0.1.0 are two completely different versions 0.1.0 This decision triggers a few needed changes to our CI processes: Trigger will be changed to react to tags being pushed instead of manually like at the moment Only the exact version specified in the tag will be built, not all product versions (at the moment building Kafka builds all supported Kafka versions, in the future pushing kafka2.8.0_stackable0.1.0 will build only kafka 2.8.0) Special Case: Multiple Dockerfiles For example Superset changed the Dockerfile between Superset version and we need to reflect these changes in our Dockerfile, which means that we effectively have to have different Dockerfiles for different Superset versions. For these scenarios we will have multiple Dockerfiles and specify the one to use in conf.py Good, because it centralizes the information about which versions are supported into each operator’s repository Good, because upgrades are predictable for the user, \"upgrading the operator upgrades the cluster\" is easy to explain and teach Good, because image tags are stable and immutable once released Bad, because we end up storing a lot of duplicate Docker images We could share the Docker layers to lessen this impact dramatically, but that would require rearchitecting our CI Bad, because it increases the overhead of doing operator or image releases Bad, because old operator versions will keep deploying older image versions than they may technically be compatible with Good, because it centralizes the information about which versions are supported into each operator’s repository Good, because upgrades are predictable for the user, \"upgrading the operator upgrades the cluster\" is easy to explain and teach Good, because image tags are stable and immutable once released Bad, because we end up storing a lot of duplicate Docker images We could share the Docker layers to lessen this impact dramatically, but that would require rearchitecting our CI Bad, because it increases the overhead of doing operator or image releases Bad, because old operator versions will keep deploying older image versions than they may technically be compatible with Good, because we preserve SemVer for image versions Good, because existing operators will upgrade as far as they are compatible Bad, because existing operators may switch which (minor-level) image version they deploy without user action (this can be mitigated in the follow up ADR on version selection though) Bad, because we don’t have a good trigger for when new image versions are released Bad, because on-prem registry mirrors may be outdated and serve incompatible versions Good, because we preserve SemVer for image versions Good, because existing operators will upgrade as far as they are compatible Bad, because existing operators may switch which (minor-level) image version they deploy without user action (this can be mitigated in the follow up ADR on version selection though) Bad, because we don’t have a good trigger for when new image versions are released Bad, because on-prem registry mirrors may be outdated and serve incompatible versions","title":"ADR018: Product Image Versioning","component":"home","version":"nightly","name":"ADR018-product_image_versioning","url":"/home/stable/contributor/adr/ADR018-product_image_versioning.html","titles":[{"text":"Glossary","hash":"_glossary","id":1},{"text":"Context and Problem Statement","hash":"_context_and_problem_statement","id":2},{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":3},{"text":"Decisions","hash":"_decisions","id":4},{"text":"Decision Drivers","hash":"_decision_drivers","id":5},{"text":"Considered Options","hash":"_considered_options","id":6},{"text":"Option Variants","hash":"_option_variants","id":7},{"text":"Variant 1 - Git tags contain only the Stackable image version","hash":"_variant_1_git_tags_contain_only_the_stackable_image_version","id":8},{"text":"Variant 2 - Git tags contain product version and stackable image version","hash":"_variant_2_git_tags_contain_product_version_and_stackable_image_version","id":9},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":10},{"text":"Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions","hash":"_synchronize_image_versions_in_lockstep_with_operator_versions","id":11},{"text":"Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version","hash":"_use_semver_for_docker_images_independently_of_operator_version","id":12},{"text":"Final List of Options to be Considered","hash":"_final_list_of_options_to_be_considered","id":13},{"text":"Scenarios","hash":"_scenarios","id":14},{"text":"Decision Outcome","hash":"_decision_outcome","id":15},{"text":"Pros and Cons of the Options","hash":"_pros_and_cons_of_the_options","id":16},{"text":"Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions - Variant 1","hash":"_synchronize_image_versions_in_lockstep_with_operator_versions_variant_1","id":17},{"text":"Synchronize image versions in lockstep with operator versions - Variant 2","hash":"_synchronize_image_versions_in_lockstep_with_operator_versions_variant_2","id":18},{"text":"Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 1","hash":"_use_semver_for_docker_images_independently_of_operator_version_variant_1","id":19},{"text":"Use SemVer for docker images, independently of operator version - Variant 2","hash":"_use_semver_for_docker_images_independently_of_operator_version_variant_2","id":20}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"Status: accepted Deciders: Felix Hennig Malte Sander Sebastian Bernauer Sönke Liebau Teo Klestrup Röijezon Date: 17.05.2022 Trino allows user to specify multiple catalogs to connect to a variety of different data-sources. We need to agree on a mechanism to Specifying Trino catalog definitions (this ADR) Connect a catalog definition to an Trino cluster (ADR020: Trino catalog usage) Multiple different types of connectors must be supported, e.g. Hive, Iceberg, Oracle and PostgreSQL. In case of catalogs that use distributed file-systems such as HDFS or S3 the access needs to be configured. TrinoCatalog CRD with discovery ConfigMaps from same namespace TrinoCatalog CRD with discovery ConfigMaps from potentially other namespaces Chosen option: \"TrinoCatalog CRD with discovery ConfigMaps from same namespace\". This option lines up with the way we want to handle discovery ConfigMaps: The operator of the service connecting to (e.g. hdfs) watches for HdfsDirectory objects and provides us with a discovery ConfigMap in the target namespace. We will start only implementing the Hive connector and support more connectors in the future. A TrinoCatalog has a top-level complex enum to distinguish between the different connector types. This way every connector can define it’s own set of attributes that it supports. Here all references to discovery ConfigMaps such as HDFS or Hive only are a string that contains the name of the ConfigMap. The ConfigMap must reside in the same namespace as the TrinoCatalog object --- # Pseudo code! TrinoCatalog metadata: name: trino-catalog namespace: default spec: hive: metastore: # mandatory configMap: my-hive-metastore s3: # S3ConnectionDef, optional inline: host: minio # OR reference: my-minio-connection hdfs: # optional configMap: my-hdfs # will provide hdfs-site.xml impersonation: true # optional, defaults to false # there is no kerberos or wireEncryption attribute, as the information about kerberos comes from the discovery configmap # OR iceberg: {} # Attributes need to be defined later on when we support iceberg # OR postgresql: {} # Attributes need to be defined later on when we support postgresql # OR [...] Looking at the example of hdfs the hdfs discovery ConfigMap will be created by the hdfs-operator. That can be the case because we are running in the same namespace as hdfs or we place a HdfsDirectory object into the Trino namespace. The hdfs-operator then detects the HdfsDirectory object and places a discovery ConfigMap into the Trino namespace. (This is similar to the way ZooKeeper’s ZNodes currently work) Good, because it’s simple and we don’t have to worry about cross-namespace access Bad, because it prohibits the usage of an HDFS in a different namespace than the TrinoCatalog namespace. This can be solved by letting the hdfs-operator put the same discovery configmap into multiple namespaces (including the one with the TrinoCatalog) Here all references to discovery ConfigMaps such as HDFS or Hive are a tuple of the name and the namespace of the ConfigMap. The namespace is optional, if not provided the same namespace from the TrinoCatalog will be used. The ConfigMap can reside in a different namespace as the TrinoCatalog object --- # Pseudo code!

There may be companies out there where different people operate Trino and manage the catalogs Bad, because if Trino instances in different stages have different catalogs a Trino Object can not be reused over the different stages Bad, because more complicated for the users Bad, because more complicated watches needed This is the same as Catalog references Clusters but instead of a list of Clusters the Catalog only contains a single Cluster. Good, because if Trino instances in different stages have different catalogs a Trino Object can be reused over the different stages Good compared to Catalog references Clusters, because an TrinoCatalog is associated with an TrinoCluster and the cluster can add additional information to it like the current deployment status Bad, because catalogs can not be reused between multiple Trino clusters This is option Mapping object between Catalog and Cluster the \"kubernetes way\".

We would very much like to include stackablectl as the CLI tool in the first release as well as demo it on the website in the configurator. In principle stackablectl is usable, but one main functionality is missing, which is the ability to apply the examples and stand up products. While just applying the examples is not a huge problem, some of our tool have external dependencies that we need to supply via helm charts at the moment (for example Trino needs a Postgres database). We need to have a way to install helm charts as part of the stacks functionality in stackablectl to make it viable for rolling out example setups. The scope of this ADR is to define a minimal solution that allows defining stacks and specifying Helm charts with properties as prerequisites before applying yaml files. This should be defined in a way that allows us as much flexibility as possible when further defining how stackablectl stacks should behave and how stacks are defined down the road, as this is an ongoing discussion. All subsequent decisions will be documented in a separate ADR. Implementation effort should be small so this can be included in release 1 Chosen solution should give flexibility to extend it without breaking changes in the future Do nothing Implement basic definition of stacks Go all in on Porter / CNAB and use it to fully define our stacks Chosen option: \"Implement basic definition of stacks\", because it is a lightweight solution that can be implemented with limited effort and matches the expected overall direction of stackablectl well. There was agreement between all deciders that we do not want to marry our solution too tightly to the as yet unproven CNAB standard or Porter as a concrete implementation. By defining our own, thin, abstraction layer we can isolate our users from the chosen implementation technologies in the backend (Porter, CNAB, Helm, …​). We can use stackablectl as CLI tool in the first official release This allows adding CNAB bundles as the preferred implementation in a non-breaking fashion later on Depending on the future direction we take with stackablectl we have a risk of needing to break the api surface that we create with this implementation We could do nothing right now and instead use the create_test_cluster.py script as our entry point for the initial release. Good, this gives us time to design a fully thought out solution before implementing something Bad, create_test_cluster.py doesn’t feel very polished and we do want to introducet stackablectl to the world as our tool of choice In order to generate a minimally invasive way to enable deploying Helm charts as prerequisites for our stacks we will introduce the initial definition of a stack roughly as shown below.

CNAB bundles can be pushed to OCI compliant registries, so we would not need to provide our own method of listing stacks for stackablectl either.

In this document we will concern ourselves with the history server. Using metrics for application monitoring requires a completely different set of protocols and technologies and is outside the scope of this document. The Spark history server is part of the Apache Spark distribution and it provides a web interface where application developers can visualize events that took place during the lifetime of a job as well as the outcome of various job phases. In this document, we propose a way to add the Spark history server to the Kubernetes resources that are managed by the Spark-on-Kubernetes operator. We also describe how Spark application definitions can leverage the history server and how the resource definitions make use of standard Stackable descriptors for S3 storage. Even though using a history server is optional when running Spark applications on the Stackable platform, it is highly recommended to make use of it in production environments. Ease of use / intuitive / checked Support multiple history servers per operator installation Integrate with the Stackable platform resource handling for S3 storage A history server is a separate entity, completely decoupled from any `SparkApplication`s. The Spark-on-k8s operator makes use of it only if available and if the Spark application developer has requested it. See the chapter below, on how `SparkApplication`s can request logging events to an existing history server. The most important part of the history server definition is the location of the event files. This is specified in the logFileDirectory entry of the resource specification as shown below. ... logFileDirectory: s3: prefix: eventlogs/ bucket: # S3BucketDef bucketName: spark-eventlogs connection: reference: eventlogs-s3-connection ... Here the event files are stored in the S3 bucket spark-eventlogs with the eventlogs/ prefix. The complete definition of the specified S3 connection is resolved by the operator from the eventlogs-s3-connection resource (not shown here). All Spark history properties can be defined in the properties section. The operator will make them available to the server at runtime. The operator makes no effort to validate these properties so extreme care must be taken making use of this section. In particular, properties concerning the event file storage can conflict with the definition provided in the logFileDirectory section and it’s not recommended to set them here at all. Here is a complete example of a history server definition: # Namespaced apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkHistoryServer metadata: name: history namespace: default spec: version: 3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 sparkConf: - # compaction - # retention/ttl - # update interval - ... cleaner: true # option of bool; default=false: sets spark.history.fs.cleaner.enabled=true # complex enum with variant s3 (hdfs later on) logFileDirectory: s3: prefix: eventlogs/ bucket: # S3BucketDef inline: bucketName: spark-eventlogs connection: inline: host: minio port: 9000 accessStyle: Path credentials: secretClass: history-server-s3-credentials Spark applications don’t have to use a history server but it’s highly recommended to do so in production environments. The section eventLogs of a SparkApplication instructs the operator to configure the application such that it can be monitored using the provided (and existing) history server. The example below shows the relevant configuration snippet of an application definition: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: spark namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 logFileDirectory: s3: prefix: eventlogs/ bucket: # S3BucketDef inline: bucketName: spark-eventlogs connection: inline: host: minio port: 9000 accessStyle: Path credentials: secretClass: eventlogs-s3-credentials s3Connection: # Optional. Used for normal data operations. inline: host: minio port: 9000 accessStyle: Path credentials: secretClass: application-s3-credentials ... In the example above, the application will log its events to the bucket specifed in logFileDirectory. In addition, the application processes data from a S3 bucket configured within the s3connection section of the specification. The operator will read the s3Connection and set up the fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider and co (endpoint, accesskey, secretkey, tls, path-style access - basically all attributes of S3Connection) settings. Afterwards if logFileDirectory attribute is set: Set fs.s3a.bucket..aws.credentials.provider and co to overwrite endpoint and credentials for the logging bucket. Set spark.eventLog.enabled property to true and will construct the spark.eventLog.dir from s3a:///. the credentials used by the HistoryServer do not have to be shared with `SparkApplication`s. Fully flexible solution, which allows the logDir to be on a different S3 ednpoint than the data. If they are on the same endpojnt, a single S3BucketDef can be shared between HistoryServer and SparkApplication for ease of use.

It uses a complex enum, similar to Option 5. Option 5 does not account for the need to specify the product version with a custom image. It is also not possible to just use a custom docker repository and still use the operator recommended version (i.e. just mirroring the stackable repository). This option makes that possible. We first start with implementing stackableVersion and custom. The stackable enum variant will be implemented as soon as we have the magic stackableVersion resolution. image: # complex enum stackableVersion: # (1) repo: docker.stackable.tech # String.

Use-case: I don’t want to specify anything, just give me defaults! → Don’t specify anything. Use-case: I want a specific version of the product: image: productVersion: 1.5.1 This resolves to the enum variant 2, with just the product version specified Use-case: I’ve mirrored the stackable repo locally, but want to use automatic image resolution: image: repo: my.repo.company.org/stackable This resolves to variant 2.

A single team can also operate multiple Stackable Data Platforms. stackablectl is build in a way customers or developers can define their own releases, stacks and demos! This way it is possible to cover the following use-cases. Any additional demos/stacks/releases you specify, will be added to the already existing ones provided by Stackable. When you have developed a new data pipeline or data product you often want to show it in action to other colleagues or potential clients. To easily achieve this you can create your own demo so that it can easily be reproduced and/or shared with other people. First you must create a mycorp-demos.yaml containing demos according to the format defined by the Stackable provided demos. After creating the mycorp-demos.yaml file it can be added to the available demos in stackablectl via the CLI argument --additional-demos-file mycorp-demos.yaml. The argument to --additional-demos-file can be either a path to a file on the local filesystem or an URL. By using an URL the demos file can be put into a central Git repository and referenced by all teams or clients. Multiple --additional-demos-file flags can be specified to include multiple demo files. Every additional demo will we added to the already existing demos in stackablectl, so all the available demo files will be merged. If your company or clients have multiple similar setups or reference architectures, it could make sense to make them easily available to all employees or clients. In the custom defined stack all product versions are pinned as well, so you can easily spin up a stack containing the exact same versions as your production setup. You can use your defined stack to give it to colleagues or potential customers to show the overall architecture of the Data Platform you’re going to build. For the overall procedure have a look at Adding a new demo on how to add a new stack. For a custom stack you need to create a mycorp-stacks.yaml containing stacks according to the format defined by the Stackable provided stacks. You can then add it to stackablectl with the flag --additional-stacks-file. If advanced users of the Stackable Platform want to define their own internal release within their company, they can easily add their own release. This has the following benefits: Same operator versions across the whole company. This produces more uniform environments and makes debugging and helping other teams easier. If the company is only interested in a subset of the available operators you can only add your relevant operators into your release and not install all the other operators. For the overall procedure have a look at Adding a new demo on how to add a new release.

It also ships with a set of pre-built Demo that utilize different data products of the Platform to get e.g. an end-to-end data pipeline. The installation of stackablectl is described in Installation. To just get a Quickstart please follow Quickstart. In general, use stackablectl --help to find out more about how to use the tool or how to use specific options. This also works with subcommands, i.e. stackablectl release install --help will show the help for installing a release. Often you can also use an abbreviation instead of typing out all of the commands.

If you don’t have a Kubernetes cluster, stackablectl can spin up a kind Kubernetes Cluster for you. The deployed services are separated into three different layers as illustrated below: This layer consists of Stackable operators managing the individual data products. They can either be installed one by one with the Operator command or from a release with the Release command which is recommended way. A release is a well-playing bundle of operators that has been extensively tested by Stackable. A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products as well as needed third-party services like Postgresql or MinIO. Stacks are installed with the Stack command.

Kafka is used as an event streaming platform to stream the data in near real-time. All the messages put in and read from Kafka are structured in dedicated queues called topics. The test data will be put in a topic called earthquakes. The records get produced (put in) by the test data generator and are consumed (read) by Druid afterwards in the same order they where produced. As Kafka itself has no webinterface you have to use a Kafka client like kafkacat. In order to connect to Kafka, use the kafka endpoint from the kafka service in your stackablectl services list command output (172.18.0.4:30968 in this case). If you have kafkacat installed, you can see the available brokers and topics with the following command. You need to replace the -b parameter to match your Kafka endpoint. $ kafkacat -b 172.18.0.4:30968 -L Metadata for all topics (from broker -1: 172.18.0.4:30968/bootstrap): 1 brokers: broker 1001 at 172.18.0.4:30755 (controller) 1 topics: topic \"earthquakes\" with 1 partitions: partition 0, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001 You can see that Kafka consists of one broker and the topic earthquakes has been created. To see some records that have been send to Kafka run the following command. You can change the number of records to print via the -c parameter. $ kafkacat -b 172.18.0.4:30968 -C -t earthquakes -c 3 {\"time\":\"1950-01-02T15:14:37.960Z\",\"latitude\":-11.242,\"longitude\":165.006,\"depth\":15.0,\"mag\":6.12,\"magType\":\"mw\",\"nst\":null,\"gap\":null,\"dmin\":null,\"rms\":null,\"net\":\"iscgem\",\"id\":\"iscgem895104\",\"updated\":\"2022-04-26T18:23:01.545Z\",\"place\":\"103 km WSW of Lata, Solomon Islands\",\"type\":\"earthquake\",\"horizontalError\":null,\"depthError\":8.6,\"magError\":0.41,\"magNst\":null,\"status\":\"reviewed\",\"locationSource\":\"iscgem\",\"magSource\":\"iscgem\"} {\"time\":\"1950-01-03T02:51:55.410Z\",\"latitude\":17.533,\"longitude\":121.447,\"depth\":30.0,\"mag\":6.5,\"magType\":\"mw\",\"nst\":null,\"gap\":null,\"dmin\":null,\"rms\":null,\"net\":\"iscgem\",\"id\":\"iscgem895106\",\"updated\":\"2022-04-26T18:23:07.394Z\",\"place\":\"6 km NNW of Tabuk, Philippines\",\"type\":\"earthquake\",\"horizontalError\":null,\"depthError\":3.8,\"magError\":0.34,\"magNst\":null,\"status\":\"reviewed\",\"locationSource\":\"iscgem\",\"magSource\":\"iscgem\"} {\"time\":\"1950-01-03T11:06:28.640Z\",\"latitude\":-45.798,\"longitude\":-77.077,\"depth\":15.0,\"mag\":6.27,\"magType\":\"mw\",\"nst\":null,\"gap\":null,\"dmin\":null,\"rms\":null,\"net\":\"iscgem\",\"id\":\"iscgem895109\",\"updated\":\"2022-04-26T18:23:08.483Z\",\"place\":\"Off the coast of Aisen, Chile\",\"type\":\"earthquake\",\"horizontalError\":null,\"depthError\":25.0,\"magError\":0.2,\"magNst\":null,\"status\":\"reviewed\",\"locationSource\":\"iscgem\",\"magSource\":\"iscgem\"} If you are interested on how many records have been produced to the Kafka topic so far, use the following command. It will print the last record produced to the topic, which will be formatted with the pattern specified in the -f parameter. The given pattern will print some metadata of the record. $ kafkacat -b 172.18.0.4:30968 -C -t earthquakes -o -1 -c 1 \\ -f 'Topic %t / Partition %p / Offset: %o / Timestamp: %T\\n' Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 2670281 / Timestamp: 1660571644060 From the output you can see, that the last record was produced at the timestamp 1660571644060 which translates to Mo 15. Aug 15:54:04 CEST 2022 (using the command date -d @1660571644). You can also see that it was the record number 2670281 send to this topic, so ~2.6 million records have been produced so far. Druid is used to ingest the near real-time data from Kafka, store it and enable SQL access to it. The demo has started an ingestion job reading earthquake records from the Kafka topic earthquakes and saving it into Druids deep storage. The Druid deep storage is based on the S3 store provided by MinIO. You can have a look at the ingestion job running in Druid by opening the given druid endpoint router-http from your stackablectl services list command output. You have to use the endpoint from your command output, in this case it is http://172.18.0.4:30109. Open it with your favorite browser. By clicking on Ingestion at the top you can see the running ingestion jobs. After clicking on the magnification glass to the right side of the RUNNING supervisor you can see additional information. On the tab Statistics on the left you can see the number of processed records as well as the number of errors. The statistics show that Druid is currently ingesting 1251 records/s and has ingested 2.1 million records so far. All records have been ingested successfully, which is indicated by having no processWithError, thrownAway or unparseable records. The started ingestion job has automatically created the Druid data source earthquakes. You can see the available data sources by clicking on Datasources at the top. By clicking on the earthquakes data source you can see the segments the data source consists of. In this case the earthquakes data source is partitioned by the year of the earthquake, resulting in 73 segments. Druid offers a web-based way of querying the data sources via SQL. To achieve this you first have to click on Query at the top. You can now enter any arbitrary SQL statement, to e.g. list 10 earthquakes run select * from earthquakes limit 10 To count the number of earthquakes per year run select time_format(__time, 'YYYY') as \"year\", count(*) as earthquakes from earthquakes group by 1 order by 1 desc Superset provides the ability to execute SQL queries and build dashboards. Open the superset endpoint external-superset in your browser (http://172.18.0.3:32108 in this case). Log in with the username admin and password admin. The demo has created a Dashboard to visualize the earthquake data. To open it click on the tab Dashboards at the top. Click on the dashboard called Earthquakes. It might take some time until the dashboards renders all the included charts. The dashboard Earthquakes consists of multiple charts. To list the charts click on the tab Charts at the top. Click on the Chart Number of earthquakes my magnitude. On the left side you can modify the chart and click on Run to see the effect. To look at the geographical distribution of the earthquakes you have to click on the tab Charts at the top again. Afterwards click on the chart Earthquake distribution. The distribution of the earthquakes matches the continental plate margins. This is the expected distribution from the Wikipedia article on Earthquakes. You can move and zoom the map with your mouse to interactively explore the map. You can e.g. have a detailed look at the detected earthquakes in Germany. You can also click on the magnitudes in the legend on the top right side to enable/disable printing the earthquakes of that magnitude. By only enabling magnitudes greater or equal to 8 you can plot only the most severe earthquakes. Within Superset you can not only create dashboards but also run arbitrary SQL statements. On the top click on the tab SQL Lab → SQL Editor. On the left select the database druid, the schema druid and set See table schema to earthquakes. On the right textbox enter the desired SQL statement. If you do not want to make one up, you can use the following: select time_format(__time, 'YYYY') as \"year\", count(*) as earthquakes from earthquakes group by 1 order by 1 desc The S3 provided by MinIO is used as a persistent deep storage for Druid to store all the data used. Open the minio endpoint console-http in your browser (http://172.18.0.4:31664 in this case). Log in with the username root and password rootroot. Click on the blue button Browse on the bucket druid and open the folders data → earthquakes. As you can see druid saved 199MB of data within 73 prefixes (folders). One prefix corresponds to on segment which in turn contains all the data of a year. If you don’t see any folders or files, the reason is that Druid has not saved its data from memory to the deep storage yet. After waiting a few minutes, the data should have been flushed to S3 and show up. If you open up a prefix for a specific year you can see that Druid has placed a file containing the data of that year there. The demo streamed 1000 earthquake records/s for a total of ~3 million earthquakes into a Kafka steaming pipeline. Druid ingested the data near real-time into its data source and enabled SQL access to it. Superset was used as a web-based frontend to execute SQL statements and build dashboards. There are multiple paths to go from here. The following sections can give you some ideas on what to explore next. You can find the description of the earthquake data on the United States Geological Survey website. Within Superset (or the Druid webinterface) you can execute arbitrary SQL statements to explore the earthquake data. You also have the possibility to create additional charts and bundle them together in a Dashboard. Have a look at the Superset documentation on how to do that. You can use a Kafka client like kafkacat to create new topics and ingest data. Using the Druid web interface, you can start an ingestion job that consumes the data and stores it in an internal data source. There is a great tutorial from Druid on how to do this. Afterwards the data source is available to be analyzed within Druid and Superset the same way the earthquake data is.","title":"kafka-druid-earthquake-data","component":"stackablectl","version":"nightly","name":"kafka-druid-earthquake-data","url":"/stackablectl/stable/demos/kafka-druid-earthquake-data.html","titles":[{"text":"List deployed Stackable services","hash":"_list_deployed_stackable_services","id":1},{"text":"Inspect data in Kafka","hash":"_inspect_data_in_kafka","id":2},{"text":"Druid","hash":"_druid","id":3},{"text":"View ingestion job","hash":"_view_ingestion_job","id":4},{"text":"Query the data source","hash":"_query_the_data_source","id":5},{"text":"Superset","hash":"_superset","id":6},{"text":"View dashboard","hash":"_view_dashboard","id":7},{"text":"View charts","hash":"_view_charts","id":8},{"text":"View the earthquake distribution on the world map","hash":"_view_the_earthquake_distribution_on_the_world_map","id":9},{"text":"Execute arbitrary SQL statements","hash":"_execute_arbitrary_sql_statements","id":10},{"text":"MinIO","hash":"_minio","id":11},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":12},{"text":"Where to go from here","hash":"_where_to_go_from_here","id":13},{"text":"Execute arbitrary SQL statements","hash":"_execute_arbitrary_sql_statements_2","id":14},{"text":"Create additional dashboards","hash":"_create_additional_dashboards","id":15},{"text":"Load additional data","hash":"_load_additional_data","id":16}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"This guide assumes you already have the demo kafka-druid-water-level-data installed.

This demo uses it as persistent storage for Druid to store all the data used Ingest water level data from the PEGELONLINE webservice into Kafka. The data contains measured water levels of different measuring stations all around Germany. If the webservice is not available this demo will not work, as it needs the webservice to ingest the data. First of, historical data of the last 31 days will be fetched and ingested Afterwards the demo will fetch the current measurement of every station approximately every two minutes and ingest it near-realtime into Kafka Start a Druid ingestion job that ingests the data into the Druid instance Create Superset dashboards for visualization of the data The whole data pipeline will have a very low latency from putting a record into Kafka to it showing up in the dashboard charts.

Starting all of the product instances might take a considerable amount of time depending on your internet connectivity. In case the product is not ready yet a warning might be shown. Kafka is used as an event streaming platform to stream the data in near real-time. All the messages put in and read from Kafka are structured in dedicated queues called topics. The test data is split across two topic called stations and measurements. The topic stations contains a record for every station that can measure the water level. The topic measurements contains a record for every measurement that has happened. The records are produced (written) by the data ingestion job and are consumed (read) by Druid afterwards in the same order they where produced. As Kafka itself has no webinterface you have to use a Kafka client like kafkacat. In order to connect to Kafka, use the kafka endpoint from the kafka service in your stackablectl services list command output (172.18.0.3:32536 in this case). If you have kafkacat installed, you can see the available brokers and topics with the following command. You need to replace the -b parameter to match your Kafka endpoint. $ kafkacat -b 172.18.0.3:32536 -L Metadata for all topics (from broker -1: 172.18.0.3:32536/bootstrap): 1 brokers: broker 1001 at 172.18.0.3:31631 (controller) 2 topics: topic \"stations\" with 1 partitions: partition 0, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001 topic \"measurements\" with 1 partitions: partition 0, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001 You can see that Kafka consists of one broker and the topics stations and measurements have been created. To see some records that have been send to Kafka run the following commands. You can change the number of records to print via the -c parameter. The | jq part can be emitted if you don’t have jq installed (it’s used to pretty-print the json here). kafkacat -b 172.18.0.3:32536 -C -t stations -c 2 | jq { \"uuid\": \"47174d8f-1b8e-4599-8a59-b580dd55bc87\", \"number\": 48900237, \"shortname\": \"EITZE\", \"longname\": \"EITZE\", \"km\": 9.56, \"agency\": \"VERDEN\", \"longitude\": 9.2767694354, \"latitude\": 52.9040654474, \"water\": { \"shortname\": \"ALLER\", \"longname\": \"ALLER\" } } { \"uuid\": \"5aaed954-de4e-4528-8f65-f3f530bc8325\", \"number\": 48900204, \"shortname\": \"RETHEM\", \"longname\": \"RETHEM\", \"km\": 34.22, \"agency\": \"VERDEN\", \"longitude\": 9.3828408101, \"latitude\": 52.7890975921, \"water\": { \"shortname\": \"ALLER\", \"longname\": \"ALLER\" } } kafkacat -b 172.18.0.3:32536 -C -t measurements -c 3 | jq { \"timestamp\": 1658151900000, \"value\": 221, \"station_uuid\": \"47174d8f-1b8e-4599-8a59-b580dd55bc87\" } { \"timestamp\": 1658152800000, \"value\": 220, \"station_uuid\": \"47174d8f-1b8e-4599-8a59-b580dd55bc87\" } { \"timestamp\": 1658153700000, \"value\": 220, \"station_uuid\": \"47174d8f-1b8e-4599-8a59-b580dd55bc87\" } The records of the two topics only contain the needed data. The measurement records contain a station_uuid to refer to the measuring station. The relationship is illustrated below. The reason for splitting the data up into two different topics is the improved performance. One simpler solution would be to use a single topic and produce records that look like the following: { \"uuid\": \"47174d8f-1b8e-4599-8a59-b580dd55bc87\", \"number\": 48900237, \"shortname\": \"EITZE\", \"longname\": \"EITZE\", \"km\": 9.56, \"agency\": \"VERDEN\", \"longitude\": 9.2767694354, \"latitude\": 52.9040654474, \"water\": { \"shortname\": \"ALLER\", \"longname\": \"ALLER\" }, \"timestamp\": 1658151900000, \"value\": 221 } ---- Notice the two last attributes that differ from the previously shown stations records. The obvious downside of this is, that every measurement (there are multiple millions of it) has to contain all the data known about the station that it was measured at. This leads to transmitting and storing duplicated information of e.g. the longitude of a station many times, resulting in increased network traffic and storage usage. The solution is to only transmit the known/needed data of either a station or a measurement. This process is called data normalization. The downside here is, that when analyzing the data you need to combine the records from multiple tables in Druid (stations and measurements). If you are interested on how many records have been produced to the Kafka topic so far, use the following command. It will print the last record produced to the topic, which will be formatted with the pattern specified in the -f parameter. The given pattern will print some metadata of the record. $ kafkacat -b 172.18.0.3:32536 -C -t stations -o -1 -c 1 \\ -f 'Topic %t / Partition %p / Offset: %o / Timestamp: %T\\n' Topic stations / Partition 0 / Offset: 688 / Timestamp: 1660829626969 688 stations have been fetched and put into Kafka. This demo does not live-stream new stations into the topic, instead it is a one-time bulk ingestion job. New stations should be pretty rare. Druid ingests the topic near-realtime regardless. So if you would produce new stations records they will shop up in Druid and are available for your analysis. $ kafkacat -b 172.18.0.3:32536 -C -t measurements -o -1 -c 1 \\ -f 'Topic %t / Partition %p / Offset: %o / Timestamp: %T\\n' Topic measurements / Partition 0 / Offset: 7586541 / Timestamp: 1660831499070 The output shows that the last measurement record was produced at the timestamp 1660831499070 which translates to Do 18. Aug 16:04:59 CEST 2022 (using the command date -d @1660831499). You can also see that it was the record number 7586541 send to this topic, so ~7.6 million records have been produced so far. Druid is used to ingest the near real-time data from Kafka, store it and enable SQL access to it. The demo has started two ingestion jobs - one reading from the topic stations and the other from measurements - and saving it into Druids deep storage. The Druid deep storage is based on the S3 store provided by MinIO. You can have a look at the ingestion jobs running in Druid by opening the given druid endpoint router-http from your stackablectl services list command output. You have to use the endpoint from your command output, in this case it is http://172.18.0.4:30899. Open it with your favorite browser. By clicking on Ingestion at the top you can see the running ingestion jobs. After clicking on the magnification glass to the right side of the RUNNING supervisor you can see additional information (here the supervisor measurements was chosen). On the tab Statistics on the left you can see the number of processed records as well as the number of errors. The statistics show that Druid is currently ingesting 3597 records/s and has ingested ~10 million records so far. All records have been ingested successfully, which is indicated by having no processWithError, thrownAway or unparseable records. The started ingestion jobs have automatically created the Druid data sources stations and measurements. You can see the available data sources by clicking on Datasources at the top. The Avg. row size (bytes) shows, that a typical measurement record has 4 bytes, while a station record has 213 bytes, which is more than 50 times the size. So with choosing two dedicated topics over a single topic, this demo was able to save 50x of storage and computation costs. By clicking on the measurements data source you can see the segments of which the data source consists of. In this case the measurements data source is partitioned by the day of the measurement, resulting in 33 segments. Druid offers a web-based way of querying the data sources via SQL. To achieve this you first have to click on Query at the top. You can now enter any arbitrary SQL statement, to e.g. list 10 stations run select * from stations limit 10 To count the measurements per day run select time_format(__time, 'YYYY/MM/dd') as \"day\", count(*) as measurements from measurements group by 1 order by 1 desc Superset provides the ability to execute SQL queries and build dashboards. Open the superset endpoint external-superset in your browser (http://172.18.0.4:32251 in this case). Log in with the username admin and password admin. The demo has created a Dashboard to visualize the water level data. To open it click on the tab Dashboards at the top. Click on the dashboard called Water level data. It might take some time until the dashboards renders all the included charts. The dashboard Water level data consists of multiple charts. To list the charts click on the tab Charts at the top. Click on the Chart Measurements / hour. On the left side you can modify the chart and click on Run to see the effect. You can see that starting from 2022/08/12 some stations didn’t measure or transmit their data. They started sending measurements again at 2022/08/14. To look at the geographical distribution of the stations you have to click on the tab Charts at the top again. Afterwards click on the chart Stations distribution. The stations are of course placed alongside of waters. They are colored by the waters they measure, so all stations alongside a body of water have the same color. You can move and zoom the map with your mouse to interactively explore the map. You can e.g. have a detailed look at the water Rhein. Within Superset you can not only create dashboards but also run arbitrary SQL statements. On the top click on the tab SQL Lab → SQL Editor. On the left select the database druid, the schema druid and set See table schema to stations or measurements. On the right textbox enter the desired SQL statement. We need to join the two tables to get interesting results. To find out the number of measurements the stations made run the following query: select stations.longname as station, count(*) as measurements from measurements inner join stations on stations.uuid = measurements.station_uuid group by 1 order by 2 desc You can also find out the number of measurements for every body of water: select stations.water_longname as water, count(*) as measurements from measurements inner join stations on stations.uuid = measurements.station_uuid group by 1 order by 2 desc What might also be interesting is the average and current measurement of the stations: select stations.longname as station, avg(\"value\") as avg_measurement, latest(\"value\") as current_measurement, latest(\"value\") - avg(\"value\") as diff from measurements inner join stations on stations.uuid = measurements.station_uuid group by 1 order by 2 desc The S3 provided by MinIO is used as a persistent deep storage for Druid to store all the data used. Open the minio endpoint console-http retrieved by stackablectl services list in your browser (http://172.18.0.5:32595 in this case). Log in with the username root and password rootroot. Click on the blue button Browse on the bucket druid and open the folders data. You can see the druid has created a folder for both data sources. Go ahead and open the folder measurements. As you can see druid saved 35MB of data within 33 prefixes (folders). One prefix corresponds to one segment which in turn contains all the measurements of a day. If you don’t see any folders or files, the reason is that Druid has not saved its data from memory to the deep storage yet. After waiting for a few minutes the data should have been flushed to S3 and show up. If you open up a prefix for a specific day you can see that Druid has placed a file containing the data of that day there. The demo put station records into the Kafka stream pipeline topic station. It also streamed ~3500 measurements/s for a total of ~11 million measurements into the topic measurements. Druid ingested the data near real-time into its data source and enabled SQL access to it. Superset was used as a web-based frontend to execute SQL statements and build dashboards. There are multiple paths to go from here. The following sections can give you some ideas on what to explore next. You can find the description of the water level data on the on the PEGELONLINE rest api documentation (German only).

You have to use the endpoint from your command output, in this case it is http://172.18.0.3:30503. Open it with your favorite browser. Log in with the username root and password rootroot. Click on the blue button Browse on the bucket demo and open the folders ny-taxi-data → raw. As you can see the demo uploaded 1GB of parquet files, one file per month. The data contain taxi rides in New York City. You can see the file size (and therefore the number of rides) decrease drastically because of the Covid-19 pandemic starting from 2020-03. Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Trino offers SQL access to the data within S3. Open the trino endpoint coordinator-https in your browser (https://172.18.0.3:30141 in this case). If you get a warning regarding the self signed certificate (e.g. Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead) you have to tell your browser to trust the website and continue. Log in with the username admin and password admin. When you start executing SQL queries you will see the queries getting processed here. Superset gives the ability to execute SQL queries and build dashboards. Open the superset endpoint external-superset in your browser (http://172.18.0.4:32295 in this case). Log in with the username admin and password admin. On the top click on the tab Dashboards. Click on the dashboard called Taxi data. It might take some time until the dashboards renders all the included charts. You can clearly see the impact of Covid-19 on the taxi business. Within Superset you can not only create dashboards but also run arbitrary SQL statements. On the top click on the tab SQL Lab → SQL Editor. On the left select the database Trino, the schema demo and set See table schema to ny_taxi_data. On the right textbox enter the desired SQL statement. If you do not want to make on up you can use the following: select format_datetime(tpep_pickup_datetime, 'YYYY/MM') as month, count(*) as trips, sum(total_amount) as sales, avg(duration_min) as avg_duration_min from ny_taxi_data group by 1 order by 1 The demo loaded 2.5 years of taxi trip data from New York City with 68 million records and a total size of 1GB in parquet files. The data was put into the S3 storage. Trino enables you to query the data via SQL. Superset was used as a web-based frontend to execute SQL statements and build dashboards. There are multiple paths to go from here. The following sections can give you some ideas on what to explore next. You can find the description of the taxi data on the New York City website. Within Superset you can execute arbitrary SQL statements to explore the taxi data. Can you answer the following questions by executing SQL statements? The Trino documentation on their SQL language might help you. How many taxi trips there where in the year 2021? See the answer select count(*) as trips from ny_taxi_data where year(tpep_pickup_datetime) = 2021 returns 30.903.982 trips. What was the maximum amount of passengers? See the answer select max(passenger_count) as max_passenger_count from ny_taxi_data; returns 112 passengers. Well that’s weird. Lets examine the passengers distribution. select passenger_count, count(*) as frequency from ny_taxi_data group by 1 order by 1 desc limit 100 returns passenger_count | frequency -----------------+----------- 112.0 | 1 96.0 | 1 9.0 | 98 8.0 | 156 7.0 | 229 6.0 | 1089568 5.0 | 1715439 4.0 | 1052834 3.0 | 2504112 2.0 | 9575299 1.0 | 48133494 0.0 | 1454268 NULL | 2698591 We can see that one trip had 112 and another one 96 passengers. All the other trips start with a more \"realistic\" number of 9 passengers. As a bonus question: What exactly did the large number of passenger do? select * from ny_taxi_data where passenger_count > 50 returns vendorid | tpep_pickup_datetime | tpep_dropoff_datetime | duration_min | passenger_count | trip_distance | payment_type | fare_amount | tip_amount | total_amount ----------+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+------------+-------------- 2 | 2021-08-01 19:47:43.000 | 2021-08-01 19:57:54.000 | 10 | 112.0 | 1.8 | Credit card | 9.0 | 2.46 | 14.76 2 | 2021-08-03 11:51:58.000 | 2021-08-03 12:09:29.000 | 17 | 96.0 | 1.56 | Credit card | 11.5 | 2.22 | 17.02 Pretty cheap for that amount of people! This probably are invalid records. What was the highest tip (measured in percentage of the original fee) ever given? See the answer select total_amount as fee, tip_amount as tip, tip_amount / total_amount * 100 as tip_percentage from ny_taxi_data where total_amount > 0 order by 3 desc limit 5 returns fee | tip | tip_percentage ------+------+-------------------- 4.2 | 10.0 | 238.0952380952381 18.2 | 25.0 | 137.36263736263737 8.24 | 9.24 | 112.13592233009709 0.66 | 0.66 | 100.0 0.01 | 0.01 | 100.0 You also have the possibility to create additional charts and bundle them together in a Dashboard. Have a look at the Superset documentation on how to do that. You can use the MinIO webinterface to upload additional data. As an alternative you can use the S3 API with an S3 client like s3cmd. It is recommended to put the data into a folder (prefix) in the demo bucket. Have a look at the defined tables inside the hive.demo schema on how to inform Trino about the newly available data. Table definitions show create table hive.demo.ny_taxi_data_raw produces something like CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hive.demo.ny_taxi_data_raw ( VendorID BIGINT, tpep_pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP, tpep_dropoff_datetime TIMESTAMP, passenger_count DOUBLE, trip_distance DOUBLE, payment_type BIGINT, Fare_amount DOUBLE, Tip_amount DOUBLE, Total_amount DOUBLE ) WITH ( external_location = 's3a://demo/ny-taxi-data/raw/', format = 'parquet' ) If you want to transform or filter your data in any way before using it e.g. in Superset you can create a view as follows: show create view hive.demo.ny_taxi_data produces something like create or replace view hive.demo.ny_taxi_data as select vendorid, tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime, date_diff('minute', tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime) as duration_min, passenger_count, trip_distance, case payment_type when 1 then 'Credit card' when 2 then 'Cash' when 3 then 'No charge' when 4 then 'Dispute' when 6 then 'Voided trino' else 'Unknown' end as payment_type, fare_amount, tip_amount, total_amount from hive.demo.ny_taxi_data_raw where tpep_pickup_datetime >= from_iso8601_timestamp('2019-12-01T00:00:00') and tpep_pickup_datetime <= from_iso8601_timestamp('2022-05-31T00:00:00') If you prefer running your SQL statements via command-line, a Python script or a graphical Database manager like DBeaver please have a look at the the Trino documentation on how to do that.","title":"trino-taxi-data","component":"stackablectl","version":"nightly","name":"trino-taxi-data","url":"/stackablectl/stable/demos/trino-taxi-data.html","titles":[{"text":"List deployed Stackable services","hash":"_list_deployed_stackable_services","id":1},{"text":"Inspect data in S3","hash":"_inspect_data_in_s3","id":2},{"text":"Use Trino webinterface","hash":"_use_trino_webinterface","id":3},{"text":"Use Superset webinterface","hash":"_use_superset_webinterface","id":4},{"text":"View the dashboard","hash":"_view_the_dashboard","id":5},{"text":"Execute arbitrary SQL statements","hash":"_execute_arbitrary_sql_statements","id":6},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":7},{"text":"Where to go from here","hash":"_where_to_go_from_here","id":8},{"text":"Execute arbitrary SQL statements","hash":"_execute_arbitrary_sql_statements_2","id":9},{"text":"Create additional dashboards","hash":"_create_additional_dashboards","id":10},{"text":"Load additional data","hash":"_load_additional_data","id":11},{"text":"Connect to Trino via CLI, Python or DBeaver","hash":"_connect_to_trino_via_cli_python_or_dbeaver","id":12}]},"64":{"id":64,"text":"AuthenticationClass is a CRD describing a generic authentication method like LDAP or Kerberos.

To build and deploy to the active Kind cluster, run: $ echo Building with Docker # Ensure that all submodules are up-to-date $ git submodule update --recursive --init # Update the Chart metadata and CRD definitions $ make compile-chart # Create a unique image ID $ REPO=secret-operator $ TAG=\"$(uuidgen)\" # Build the image $ docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile -t \"$REPO:$TAG\" # Load the image onto the Kind nodes $ kind load docker-image \"$REPO:$TAG\" # Deploy $ helm upgrade secret-operator deploy/helm/secret-operator \\ --install \\ --set-string \"image.repository=$REPO,image.tag=$TAG\" To build and deploy to the active Kind cluster, run: $ echo Building with Nix # Ensure that all submodules are up-to-date $ git submodule update --recursive --init # Ensure that the Cargo.lock is up-to-date # This is not required if you use a tool that invokes Cargo regularly anyway, such as Rust-Analyzer $ cargo generate-lockfile # Use crate2nix (https://github.com/kolloch/crate2nix) to convert Cargo.lock into a Nix derivation $ nix run -f . crate2nix generate # Build the Docker images $ nix build -f . docker # Load the images onto the Kind nodes # Nix does not use the Docker daemon, instead it builds individual layers, as well as a script (`result/load-image`) that combines them into a Docker image archive $ kind load image-archive <(./result/load-image) # Deploy $ kubectl apply -f result/crds.yaml -f provisioner.yaml $ kubectl rollout restart ds/secret-provisioner You may need to add extra-experimental-features = nix-command to /etc/nix/nix.conf, or add --experimental-features nix-command to the Nix commands. You can also use Tilt to automatically recompile and redeploy when files are changed: $ nix run -f . tilt up Secret-Operator, as with most CSI providers, requires the Kubernetes node’s root folder to be mounted as rshared. K3d does not do this by default, but can be prodded into doing this by running mount --make-rshared / in each node container. To do this for each running node K3d node, run the following script: for i in $(k3d node list -o json | jq -r .[].name); do docker exec -it $i mount --make-rshared / done This is not persistent, and must be re-executed every time the cluster (or a node in it) is restarted.","title":"Building the Operator","component":"secret-operator","version":"0.5","name":"building","url":"/secret-operator/stable/building.html","titles":[{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":1},{"text":"Nix","hash":"_nix","id":2},{"text":"K3d","hash":"_k3d","id":3}]},"81":{"id":81,"text":"Required: true Multiple values: false Environment variable: CSI_ENDPOINT The path to the Container Storage Interface Unix Domain Socket that the operator should listen on.","title":"","component":"secret-operator","version":"0.5","name":"commandline_args","url":"/secret-operator/stable/commandline_args.html","titles":[{"text":"--csi-endpoint","hash":"_csi_endpoint","id":1}]},"82":{"id":82,"text":"This operator accepts the following command line parameters: Required: true Multiple values: false Environment variable: CSI_ENDPOINT The path to the Container Storage Interface Unix Domain Socket that the operator should listen on.","title":"Configuration","component":"secret-operator","version":"0.5","name":"configuration","url":"/secret-operator/stable/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Command Line Parameters","hash":"_command_line_parameters","id":1},{"text":"--csi-endpoint","hash":"_csi_endpoint","id":2}]},"83":{"id":83,"text":"This is an operator for Kubernetes that provisions and injects secrets into Kubernetes Pods.","title":"Stackable Secret Operator","component":"secret-operator","version":"0.5","name":"index","url":"/secret-operator/stable/index.html","titles":[]},"84":{"id":84,"text":"There are two ways to run the Stackable Secret Operator: Helm managed Docker container deployment on Kubernetes Build from source Helm allows you to download and deploy Stackable operators on Kubernetes and is by far the easiest installation method.

The adminUser fields are used by the init command to create an admin user.

This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. Where: metadata.name contains the name of the Airflow cluster the label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in spec.version spec.statsdExporterVersion must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository. spec.executor: this setting determines how the cluster will run (for more information see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/index.html#executor-types): the CeleryExecutor is the recommended setting although SequentialExecutor (all jobs run in one process in series) and LocalExecutor (whereby all jobs are run on one node, using whatever parallelism is possible) are also supported importing the sample workflows is determined by loadExamples exposeConfig allows the contents of the configuration file airflow.cfg to be exposed via the webserver UI. This is only for debugging purposes and should be set to false otherwise as it presents a security risk. the previously created secret must be referenced in credentialsSecret Each cluster requires 3 components: webservers: this provides the main UI for user-interaction workers: the nodes over which the job workload will be distributed by the scheduler schedulers: responsible for triggering jobs and persisting their metadata to the backend database The managed Airflow instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. Additionally for Airflow it is recommended that each component has the same configuration: not all components use each setting, but some things - such as external end-points - need to be consistent for things to work as expected. Airflow exposes an environment variable for every configuration setting, a list of which can be found in the Configuration Reference. Although Kubernetes can override these settings in one of two ways (Configuration overrides, or Environment Variable overrides), the affect is the same and currently only the latter is implemented. This is described in the following section. These can be set - or overwritten - at either the role level: webservers: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL: \"8\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 Or per role group: webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL: \"8\" replicas: 1 In both examples above we are replacing the default value of the UI DAG refresh (3s) with 8s. Note that all override property values must be strings. Airflow comes with a default embedded database (intended only for standalone mode): for cluster usage an external database is used such as PostgreSQL, described above. This database must be initialized with an airflow schema and the Admin user defined in the airflow credentials Secret. This is done the first time the cluster is created and can take a few moments. When the Airflow cluster is created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the browser. The Airflow port which defaults to 8080 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward airflow-webserver-default-0 8080 Then it can be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8080. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret: If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available: Click on an example DAG and then invoke the job: if the scheduler is correctly set up then the job will run and the job tree will update automatically: The managed Airflow instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details DAGs can be mounted by using a ConfigMap or a PersistentVolumeClaim. This is best illustrated with an example of each, shown in the next section. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cm-dag (1) data: test_airflow_dag.py: | (2) from datetime import datetime, timedelta from airflow import DAG from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator with DAG( dag_id='test_airflow_dag', schedule_interval='0 0 * * *', start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1), catchup=False, dagrun_timeout=timedelta(minutes=60), tags=['example', 'example2'], params={\"example_key\": \"example_value\"}, ) as dag: run_this_last = DummyOperator( task_id='run_this_last', ) # [START howto_operator_bash] run_this = BashOperator( task_id='run_after_loop', bash_command='echo 1', ) # [END howto_operator_bash] run_this >> run_this_last for i in range(3): task = BashOperator( task_id='runme_' + str(i), bash_command='echo \"{{ task_instance_key_str }}\" && sleep 1', ) task >> run_this # [START howto_operator_bash_template] also_run_this = BashOperator( task_id='also_run_this', bash_command='echo \"run_id={{ run_id }} | dag_run={{ dag_run }}\"', ) # [END howto_operator_bash_template] also_run_this >> run_this_last # [START howto_operator_bash_skip] this_will_skip = BashOperator( task_id='this_will_skip', bash_command='echo \"hello world\"; exit 99;', dag=dag, ) # [END howto_operator_bash_skip] this_will_skip >> run_this_last if __name__ == \"__main__\": dag.cli() --- apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow spec: version: 2.2.5-python39-stackable0.3.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 executor: CeleryExecutor loadExamples: false exposeConfig: false credentialsSecret: simple-airflow-credentials volumes: - name: cm-dag (3) configMap: name: cm-dag (4) volumeMounts: - name: cm-dag (5) mountPath: /dags/test_airflow_dag.py (6) subPath: test_airflow_dag.py (7) webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/dags\" (8) replicas: 1 workers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/dags\" (8) replicas: 2 schedulers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/dags\" (8) replicas: 1 1 The name of the configuration map 2 The name of the DAG (this is a renamed copy of the example_bash_operator.py from the Airflow examples) 3 The volume backed by the configuration map 4 The name of the configuration map referenced by the Airflow cluster 5 The name of the mounted volume 6 The path of the mounted resource. Note that should map to a single DAG. 7 The resource has to be defined using subPath: this is to prevent the versioning of configuration map elements which may cause a conflict with how Airflow propagates DAGs between its components. 8 If the mount path described above is anything other than the standard location (the default is $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags), then the location should be defined using the relevant environment variable. The advantage of this approach is that a DAG can be provided \"in-line\", as it were. This becomes cumbersome when multiple DAGs are to be made available in this way, as each one has to be mapped individually. For multiple DAGs it is probably easier to expose them all via a mounted volume, which is shown below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-airflow (1) spec: accessModes:

See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. Additionally for Airflow it is recommended that each component has the same configuration: not all components use each setting, but some things - such as external end-points - need to be consistent for things to work as expected. Airflow exposes an environment variable for every configuration setting, a list of which can be found in the Configuration Reference. Although Kubernetes can override these settings in one of two ways (Configuration overrides, or Environment Variable overrides), the affect is the same and currently only the latter is implemented. This is described in the following section. These can be set - or overwritten - at either the role level: webservers: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL: \"8\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 Or per role group: webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL: \"8\" replicas: 1 In both examples above we are replacing the default value of the UI DAG refresh (3s) with 8s. Note that all override property values must be strings. Airflow comes with a default embedded database (intended only for standalone mode): for cluster usage an external database is used such as PostgreSQL, described above. This database must be initialized with an airflow schema and the Admin user defined in the airflow credentials Secret. This is done the first time the cluster is created and can take a few moments. When the Airflow cluster is created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the browser. The Airflow port which defaults to 8080 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward airflow-webserver-default-0 8080 Then it can be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8080. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret: If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available: Click on an example DAG and then invoke the job: if the scheduler is correctly set up then the job will run and the job tree will update automatically: Every user has to authenticate themselves before using Airflow and there are several ways of doing this. The default setting is to view and manually set up users via the Webserver UI. Note the blue \"+\" button where users can be added directly: Airflow supports authentication of users against an LDAP server. Have a look at the LDAP example and the general Stackable Authentication documentation on how to set it up. In general, it requires you to specify a AuthenticationClass which is used to authenticate the users. In the example below we assign all the users the Admin role once they log into Airflow: apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow-with-ldap spec: version: 2.2.5-python39-stackable0.3.0 [...] authenticationConfig: authenticationClass: airflow-with-ldap-ldap userRegistrationRole: Admin The users and roles can be viewed as before in the Webserver UI, but note that the blue \"+\" button is not available when authenticating against LDAP: The Airflow Webserver delegates the handling of user access control to Flask AppBuilder. You can view, add to, and assign the roles displayed in the Airflow Webserver UI to existing users. Airflow supports assigning roles to users based on their LDAP group membership , though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator. Currently, all the users logging in via LDAP get assigned the same role which you can configure via the attribute authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole on the AirflowCluster object. The managed Airflow instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details DAGs can be mounted by using a ConfigMap or a PersistentVolumeClaim.

Airflow expects that all its components (webserver, scheduler, workers etc.) have access to the DAG folder. If this is mounted via a PersistentVolumeClaim, then the permissible access modes on that claim may require that a specific node is selected.

Afterwards you can verify that it works by running and tracking an example DAG. As we have installed the external dependencies required by Airflow (Postgresql and Redis) we can now install the Airflow cluster itself. A secret with the necessary credentials must be created, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Airflow itself. Create a file called airflow-credentials.yaml: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: simple-airflow-credentials type: Opaque stringData: adminUser.username: airflow adminUser.firstname: Airflow adminUser.lastname: Admin adminUser.email: airflow@airflow.com adminUser.password: airflow connections.secretKey: thisISaSECRET_1234 connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri: postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@airflow-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/airflow connections.celeryResultBackend: db+postgresql://airflow:airflow@airflow-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/airflow connections.celeryBrokerUrl: redis://:redis@airflow-redis-master:6379/0 And apply it: kubectl apply -f airflow-credentials.yaml The connections.secretKey will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes. connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Airflow metadata. connections.celeryResultBackend must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the job metadata (in the example above we are using the same postgresql database for both). connections.celeryBrokerUrl must contain the connection string to the Redis instance used for queuing the jobs submitted to the airflow worker(s). The adminUser fields are used to create an admin user. Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP. An Airflow cluster is made of up three components: webserver: this provides the main UI for user-interaction workers: the nodes over which the job workload will be distributed by the scheduler scheduler: responsible for triggering jobs and persisting their metadata to the backend database Create a file named airflow.yaml with the following contents: --- apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow spec: version: 2.2.5-python39-stackable0.3.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 executor: CeleryExecutor loadExamples: true exposeConfig: false credentialsSecret: simple-airflow-credentials webservers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 workers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 2 schedulers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 And apply it: kubectl apply -f airflow.yaml Where: metadata.name contains the name of the Airflow cluster the label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in spec.version spec.statsdExporterVersion must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository. spec.executor: this setting determines how the cluster will run (for more information see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/index.html#executor-types): the CeleryExecutor is the recommended setting although SequentialExecutor (all jobs run in one process in series) and LocalExecutor (whereby all jobs are run on one node, using whatever parallelism is possible) are also supported the spec.loadExamples key is optional and defaults to false. It is set to true here as the example DAGs will be used when verifying the installation. the spec.exposeConfig key is optional and defaults to false. It is set to true only as an aid to verify the configuration and should never be used as such in anything other than test or demo clusters. the previously created secret must be referenced in spec.credentialsSecret Please note that the version you need to specify for spec.version is not only the version of Apache Airflow which you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. This will create the actual Airflow cluster. When creating an Airflow cluster, a database-initialization job is first started to ensure that the database schema is present and correct (i.e. populated with an admin user). A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while. You can use kubectl to wait on the resource, although the cluster itself will not be created until this step is complete.: kubectl wait airflowdb/airflow \\ --for jsonpath='{.status.condition}'=Ready \\ --timeout 300s The job status can be inspected and verified like this: kubectl get jobs which will show something like this: NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE airflow 1/1 85s 11m Then, make sure that all the Pods in the StatefulSets are ready: kubectl get statefulset The output should show all pods ready, including the external dependencies: NAME READY AGE airflow-postgresql 1/1 16m airflow-redis-master 1/1 16m airflow-redis-replicas 1/1 16m airflow-scheduler-default 1/1 11m airflow-webserver-default 1/1 11m airflow-worker-default 2/2 11m The completed set of pods for the Airflow cluster will look something like this: When the Airflow cluster has been created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the browser: the webserver UI port defaults to 8080 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward svc/airflow-webserver 8080 2>&1 >/dev/null & The Webserver UI can now be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8080. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret: Since the examples were loaded in the cluster definition, they will appear under the DAGs tabs: Select one of these DAGs by clicking on the name in the left-hand column e.g. example_complex. Click on the arrow in the top right of the screen, select \"Trigger DAG\" and the DAG nodes will be automatically highlighted as the job works through its phases. Great! You have set up an Airflow cluster, connected to it and run your first DAG! Alternative: Using the command line If you prefer to interact directly with the API instead of using the web interface, you can use the following commands. The DAG is one of the example DAGs named example_complex. To trigger a DAG run via the API requires an initial extra step to ensure that the DAG is not in a paused state: curl -s --user airflow:airflow -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ -XPATCH http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/example_complex \\ -d '{\"is_paused\": false}' A DAG can then be triggered by providing the DAG name (in this case, example_complex). The response identifies the DAG identifier, which we can parse out of the JSON like this: curl -s --user airflow:airflow -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ -XPOST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/example_complex/dagRuns \\ -d '{}' | jq -r '.dag_run_id' If we read this identifier into a variable such as dag_id (or replace it manually in the command) we can run this command to access the status of the DAG run: curl -s --user airflow:airflow -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ -XGET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/example_complex/dagRuns/\"$dag_id\" | jq -r '.state' Look at the Usage page to find out more about configuring your Airflow cluster and loading your own DAG files.","title":"First steps","component":"airflow","version":"0.5","name":"first_steps","url":"/airflow/stable/getting_started/first_steps.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Secret with Airflow credentials","hash":"_secret_with_airflow_credentials","id":2},{"text":"Airflow","hash":"_airflow","id":3},{"text":"Initialization of the Airflow database","hash":"_initialization_of_the_airflow_database","id":4},{"text":"Verify that it works","hash":"_verify_that_it_works","id":5},{"text":"What’s next","hash":"_whats_next","id":6}]},"116":{"id":116,"text":"This guide will get you started with Airflow using the Stackable Operator.

Follow the installation steps for your platform. After you have installed stackablectl run the following command to install all Operators necessary for Airflow: stackablectl operator install \\ commons=0.3.0-nightly \\ secret=0.6.0-nightly \\ airflow=0.5.0-nightly The tool will show [INFO ] Installing commons operator [INFO ] Installing secret operator [INFO ] Installing airflow operator Consult the Quickstart to learn more about how to use stackablectl.

See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. Additionally for Airflow it is recommended that each component has the same configuration: not all components use each setting, but some things - such as external end-points - need to be consistent for things to work as expected. Airflow exposes an environment variable for every configuration setting, a list of which can be found in the Configuration Reference. Although Kubernetes can override these settings in one of two ways (Configuration overrides, or Environment Variable overrides), the affect is the same and currently only the latter is implemented. This is described in the following section. These can be set - or overwritten - at either the role level: webservers: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL: \"8\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 Or per role group: webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL: \"8\" replicas: 1 In both examples above we are replacing the default value of the UI DAG refresh (3s) with 8s. Note that all override property values must be strings. Airflow comes with a default embedded database (intended only for standalone mode): for cluster usage an external database is used such as PostgreSQL, described above. This database must be initialized with an airflow schema and the Admin user defined in the airflow credentials Secret. This is done the first time the cluster is created and can take a few moments. When the Airflow cluster is created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the browser. The Airflow port which defaults to 8080 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward airflow-webserver-default-0 8080 Then it can be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8080. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret: If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available: Click on an example DAG and then invoke the job: if the scheduler is correctly set up then the job will run and the job tree will update automatically: Every user has to authenticate themselves before using Airflow and there are several ways of doing this. The default setting is to view and manually set up users via the Webserver UI. Note the blue \"+\" button where users can be added directly: Airflow supports authentication of users against an LDAP server. Have a look at the LDAP example and the general Stackable Authentication documentation on how to set it up. In general, it requires you to specify a AuthenticationClass which is used to authenticate the users. In the example below we assign all the users the Admin role once they log into Airflow: apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow-with-ldap spec: version: 2.2.5-python39-stackable0.3.0 [...] authenticationConfig: authenticationClass: airflow-with-ldap-ldap userRegistrationRole: Admin The users and roles can be viewed as before in the Webserver UI, but note that the blue \"+\" button is not available when authenticating against LDAP: The Airflow Webserver delegates the handling of user access control to Flask AppBuilder. You can view, add to, and assign the roles displayed in the Airflow Webserver UI to existing users. Airflow supports assigning roles to users based on their LDAP group membership , though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator. Currently, all the users logging in via LDAP get assigned the same role which you can configure via the attribute authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole on the AirflowCluster object. The managed Airflow instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details DAGs can be mounted by using a ConfigMap or a PersistentVolumeClaim. This is best illustrated with an example of each, shown in the next section. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cm-dag (1) data: test_airflow_dag.py: | (2) from datetime import datetime, timedelta from airflow import DAG from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator with DAG( dag_id='test_airflow_dag', schedule_interval='0 0 * * *', start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1), catchup=False, dagrun_timeout=timedelta(minutes=60), tags=['example', 'example2'], params={\"example_key\": \"example_value\"}, ) as dag: run_this_last = DummyOperator( task_id='run_this_last', ) # [START howto_operator_bash] run_this = BashOperator( task_id='run_after_loop', bash_command='echo 1', ) # [END howto_operator_bash] run_this >> run_this_last for i in range(3): task = BashOperator( task_id='runme_' + str(i), bash_command='echo \"{{ task_instance_key_str }}\" && sleep 1', ) task >> run_this # [START howto_operator_bash_template] also_run_this = BashOperator( task_id='also_run_this', bash_command='echo \"run_id={{ run_id }} | dag_run={{ dag_run }}\"', ) # [END howto_operator_bash_template] also_run_this >> run_this_last # [START howto_operator_bash_skip] this_will_skip = BashOperator( task_id='this_will_skip', bash_command='echo \"hello world\"; exit 99;', dag=dag, ) # [END howto_operator_bash_skip] this_will_skip >> run_this_last if __name__ == \"__main__\": dag.cli() --- apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow spec: version: 2.2.5-python39-stackable0.3.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 executor: CeleryExecutor loadExamples: false exposeConfig: false credentialsSecret: simple-airflow-credentials volumes: - name: cm-dag (3) configMap: name: cm-dag (4) volumeMounts: - name: cm-dag (5) mountPath: /dags/test_airflow_dag.py (6) subPath: test_airflow_dag.py (7) webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/dags\" (8) replicas: 1 workers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/dags\" (8) replicas: 2 schedulers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/dags\" (8) replicas: 1 1 The name of the configuration map 2 The name of the DAG (this is a renamed copy of the example_bash_operator.py from the Airflow examples) 3 The volume backed by the configuration map 4 The name of the configuration map referenced by the Airflow cluster 5 The name of the mounted volume 6 The path of the mounted resource. Note that should map to a single DAG. 7 The resource has to be defined using subPath: this is to prevent the versioning of configuration map elements which may cause a conflict with how Airflow propagates DAGs between its components. 8 If the mount path described above is anything other than the standard location (the default is $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags), then the location should be defined using the relevant environment variable. The advantage of this approach is that a DAG can be provided \"in-line\", as it were. This becomes cumbersome when multiple DAGs are to be made available in this way, as each one has to be mapped individually. For multiple DAGs it is probably easier to expose them all via a mounted volume, which is shown below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-airflow (1) spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job (2) metadata: name: airflow-dags spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: Never volumes: - name: external-dags (3) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-airflow (4) initContainers: - name: dest-dir image: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/tools:0.2.0-stackable0 env: - name: DEST_DIR value: \"/stackable/externals\" command: [ \"bash\", \"-x\", \"-c\", \"mkdir -p $DEST_DIR && chown stackable:stackable ${DEST_DIR} && chmod -R a=,u=rwX,g=rwX ${DEST_DIR}\", ] securityContext: runAsUser: 0 volumeMounts: - name: external-dags (5) mountPath: /stackable/externals (6) containers: - name: airflow-dags image: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/tools:0.2.0-stackable0 env: - name: DEST_DIR value: \"/stackable/externals\" command: (7) [ \"bash\", \"-x\", \"-c\", \"curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/2.2.5/airflow/example_dags/example_bash_operator.py \\ -o ${DEST_DIR}/example_bash_operator.py && \\ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/2.2.5/airflow/example_dags/example_complex.py \\ -o ${DEST_DIR}/example_complex.py && \\ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/2.2.5/airflow/example_dags/example_branch_datetime_operator.py \\ -o ${DEST_DIR}/example_branch_datetime_operator.py\", ] volumeMounts: - name: external-dags (5) mountPath: /stackable/externals (6) --- apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow spec: version: 2.2.4-python39-stackable0.3.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 executor: CeleryExecutor loadExamples: false exposeConfig: false credentialsSecret: simple-airflow-credentials volumes: - name: external-dags (8) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-airflow (9) volumeMounts: - name: external-dags (10) mountPath: /stackable/external-dags (11) webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/stackable/external-dags\" (12) replicas: 1 workers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/stackable/external-dags\" (12) replicas: 2 schedulers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/stackable/external-dags\" (12) replicas: 1 1 The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that references the PV 2 Job used to populate the PersistentVolumeClaim with DAG files 3 The volume name that will be mounted as a target for the DAG files 4 Defines the Volume backed by the PVC, local to the Custom Resource 5 The VolumeMount used by the Custom Resource 6 The path for the VolumeMount 7 The command used to access/download the DAG files to a specified location 8 The Volume used by this Custom Resource 9 The PersistentVolumeClaim that backs this Volume 10 The VolumeMount referencing the Volume in the previous step 11 The path where this Volume is located for each role (webserver, worker, scheduler) 12 If the mount path described above is anything other than the standard location (the default is $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags), then the location should be defined using the relevant environment variable. Airflow expects that all its components (webserver, scheduler, workers etc.) have access to the DAG folder. If this is mounted via a PersistentVolumeClaim, then the permissible access modes on that claim may require that a specific node is selected. This can be done by providing a label-match as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER: \"/stackable/external-dags\" replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: node: \"2\" Airflow can be used to apply custom resources from within a cluster. An example of this could be a SparkApplication job that is to be triggered by Airflow. The steps below describe how this can be done. An in-cluster connection can either be created from within the Webserver UI (note that the \"in cluster configuration\" box is ticked): Alternatively, the connection can be defined by an environment variable in URI format: AIRFLOW_CONN_KUBERNETES_IN_CLUSTER: \"kubernetes://?__extra__=%7B%22extra__kubernetes__in_cluster%22%3A+true%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config_path%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__namespace%22%3A+%22%22%7D\" This can be supplied directly in the custom resource for all roles (Airflow expects configuration to be common across components): --- apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow spec: version: 2.2.3-python38-stackable0.3.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 executor: CeleryExecutor loadExamples: false exposeConfig: false credentialsSecret: simple-airflow-credentials webservers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW_CONN_KUBERNETES_IN_CLUSTER: \"kubernetes://?__extra__=%7B%22extra__kubernetes__in_cluster%22%3A+true%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config_path%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__namespace%22%3A+%22%22%7D\" replicas: 1 workers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW_CONN_KUBERNETES_IN_CLUSTER: \"kubernetes://?__extra__=%7B%22extra__kubernetes__in_cluster%22%3A+true%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config_path%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__namespace%22%3A+%22%22%7D\" replicas: 1 schedulers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: AIRFLOW_CONN_KUBERNETES_IN_CLUSTER: \"kubernetes://?__extra__=%7B%22extra__kubernetes__in_cluster%22%3A+true%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__kube_config_path%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22extra__kubernetes__namespace%22%3A+%22%22%7D\" replicas: 1 Airflow cannot create or access SparkApplication resources by default - a cluster role is required for this: --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: name: airflow-spark-clusterrole rules: - apiGroups: - spark.stackable.tech resources: - sparkapplications verbs: - create - get and a corresponding cluster role binding: --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: airflow-spark-clusterrole-binding roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: airflow-spark-clusterrole subjects: - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Group name: system:serviceaccounts Now for the DAG itself.

Afterwards you can verify that it works by running and tracking an example DAG. As we have installed the external dependencies required by Airflow (Postgresql and Redis) we can now install the Airflow cluster itself. A secret with the necessary credentials must be created, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Airflow itself. Create a file called airflow-credentials.yaml: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: simple-airflow-credentials type: Opaque stringData: adminUser.username: airflow adminUser.firstname: Airflow adminUser.lastname: Admin adminUser.email: airflow@airflow.com adminUser.password: airflow connections.secretKey: thisISaSECRET_1234 connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri: postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@airflow-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/airflow connections.celeryResultBackend: db+postgresql://airflow:airflow@airflow-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/airflow connections.celeryBrokerUrl: redis://:redis@airflow-redis-master:6379/0 And apply it: kubectl apply -f airflow-credentials.yaml The connections.secretKey will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes. connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Airflow metadata. connections.celeryResultBackend must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the job metadata (in the example above we are using the same postgresql database for both). connections.celeryBrokerUrl must contain the connection string to the Redis instance used for queuing the jobs submitted to the airflow worker(s). The adminUser fields are used to create an admin user. Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP. An Airflow cluster is made of up three components: webserver: this provides the main UI for user-interaction workers: the nodes over which the job workload will be distributed by the scheduler scheduler: responsible for triggering jobs and persisting their metadata to the backend database Create a file named airflow.yaml with the following contents: --- apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AirflowCluster metadata: name: airflow spec: version: 2.2.5-python39-stackable0.3.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 executor: CeleryExecutor loadExamples: true exposeConfig: false credentialsSecret: simple-airflow-credentials webservers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 workers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 2 schedulers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 And apply it: kubectl apply -f airflow.yaml Where: metadata.name contains the name of the Airflow cluster the label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in spec.version spec.statsdExporterVersion must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository. spec.executor: this setting determines how the cluster will run (for more information see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/index.html#executor-types): the CeleryExecutor is the recommended setting although SequentialExecutor (all jobs run in one process in series) and LocalExecutor (whereby all jobs are run on one node, using whatever parallelism is possible) are also supported the spec.loadExamples key is optional and defaults to false. It is set to true here as the example DAGs will be used when verifying the installation. the spec.exposeConfig key is optional and defaults to false. It is set to true only as an aid to verify the configuration and should never be used as such in anything other than test or demo clusters. the previously created secret must be referenced in spec.credentialsSecret Please note that the version you need to specify for spec.version is not only the version of Apache Airflow which you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. This will create the actual Airflow cluster. When creating an Airflow cluster, a database-initialization job is first started to ensure that the database schema is present and correct (i.e. populated with an admin user). A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while. You can use kubectl to wait on the resource, although the cluster itself will not be created until this step is complete.: kubectl wait airflowdb/airflow \\ --for jsonpath='{.status.condition}'=Ready \\ --timeout 300s The job status can be inspected and verified like this: kubectl get jobs which will show something like this: NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE airflow 1/1 85s 11m Then, make sure that all the Pods in the StatefulSets are ready: kubectl get statefulset The output should show all pods ready, including the external dependencies: NAME READY AGE airflow-postgresql 1/1 16m airflow-redis-master 1/1 16m airflow-redis-replicas 1/1 16m airflow-scheduler-default 1/1 11m airflow-webserver-default 1/1 11m airflow-worker-default 2/2 11m The completed set of pods for the Airflow cluster will look something like this: When the Airflow cluster has been created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the browser: the webserver UI port defaults to 8080 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward svc/airflow-webserver 8080 2>&1 >/dev/null & The Webserver UI can now be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8080. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret: Since the examples were loaded in the cluster definition, they will appear under the DAGs tabs: Select one of these DAGs by clicking on the name in the left-hand column e.g. example_complex. Click on the arrow in the top right of the screen, select \"Trigger DAG\" and the DAG nodes will be automatically highlighted as the job works through its phases. Great! You have set up an Airflow cluster, connected to it and run your first DAG! Alternative: Using the command line If you prefer to interact directly with the API instead of using the web interface, you can use the following commands. The DAG is one of the example DAGs named example_complex. To trigger a DAG run via the API requires an initial extra step to ensure that the DAG is not in a paused state: curl -s --user airflow:airflow -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ -XPATCH http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/example_complex \\ -d '{\"is_paused\": false}' A DAG can then be triggered by providing the DAG name (in this case, example_complex). The response identifies the DAG identifier, which we can parse out of the JSON like this: curl -s --user airflow:airflow -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ -XPOST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/example_complex/dagRuns \\ -d '{}' | jq -r '.dag_run_id' If we read this identifier into a variable such as dag_id (or replace it manually in the command) we can run this command to access the status of the DAG run: curl -s --user airflow:airflow -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ -XGET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/example_complex/dagRuns/\"$dag_id\" | jq -r '.state' Look at the Usage page to find out more about configuring your Airflow cluster and loading your own DAG files.","title":"First steps","component":"airflow","version":"nightly","name":"first_steps","url":"/airflow/nightly/getting_started/first_steps.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Secret with Airflow credentials","hash":"_secret_with_airflow_credentials","id":2},{"text":"Airflow","hash":"_airflow","id":3},{"text":"Initialization of the Airflow database","hash":"_initialization_of_the_airflow_database","id":4},{"text":"Verify that it works","hash":"_verify_that_it_works","id":5},{"text":"What’s next","hash":"_whats_next","id":6}]},"124":{"id":124,"text":"This guide will get you started with Airflow using the Stackable Operator.

Follow the installation steps for your platform. After you have installed stackablectl run the following command to install all Operators necessary for Airflow: stackablectl operator install \\ commons=0.3.0-nightly \\ secret=0.6.0-nightly \\ airflow=0.5.0-nightly The tool will show [INFO ] Installing commons operator [INFO ] Installing secret operator [INFO ] Installing airflow operator Consult the Quickstart to learn more about how to use stackablectl. For example, you can use the -k flag to create a Kubernetes cluster with kind. You can also use Helm to install the Operators.

Connect to the simple-druid-router NodePort service and follow the druid documentation on how to load and query sample data. The Stackable Platform uses a common set of resource definitions for s3 across all operators, explained in detail on the S3 resources page. In general, you can configure an S3 connection or bucket inline, or as a reference to a dedicated object. In Druid, S3 can be used for two things: Ingesting data from a bucket Using it as a backend for deep storage You can specify just a connection/bucket or just one of these or for both, but Druid only supports a single S3 endpoint under the hood, so if two connections are specified, they must be the same. This is easiest if a dedicated S3 Connection Resource is used. TLS for S3 is not yet supported. To ingest data from s3, you need to specify at least an endpoint to use, but there are more settings that can be set: spec: ingestion: s3connection: host: yourhost.com (1) port: 80 # optional (2) secretClass: my-s3-credentials # optional (3) 1 The S3 host, not optional 2 Port, optional, defaults to 80 3 Credentials to use. Since these might be bucket-dependent, they can instead be given in the ingestion job Druid can use S3 as a backend for deep storage: spec: deepStorage: s3: inline: bucketName: my-bucket (1) connection: inline: host: test-minio (2) port: 9000 (3) secretClass: minio-credentials (4) 1 Bucket name. 2 Bucket host. 3 Optional bucket port. 4 Name of the Secret object expected to contain the following keys: ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. It is also possible to configure the bucket connection details as a separate Kubernetes resource and only refer to that object from the DruidCluster like this: spec: deepStorage: s3: reference: my-bucket-resource (1) 1 Name of the bucket resource with connection details. The resource named my-bucket-resource is then defined as shown below: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Bucket metadata: name: my-bucket-resource spec: bucketName: my-bucket-name connection: inline: host: test-minio port: 9000 secretClass: minio-credentials This has the advantage that bucket configuration can be shared across `DruidClusters`s (and other stackable CRDs) and reduces the cost of updating these details. Druid can connect to an Open Policy Agent (OPA) instance for authorization policy decisions. You need to run an OPA instance to connect to, for which we refer to the OPA Operator docs. How you can write RegoRules for Druid is explained below. Once you have defined your rules, you need to configure the OPA cluster name and endpoint to use for Druid authorization requests. Add a section to the spec for OPA: opa: configMapName: simple-opa (1) package: my-druid-rules (2) 1 The name of your OPA cluster (simple-opa in this case) 2 The RegoRule package to use for policy decisions. The package should contain an allow rule. This is optional and will default to the name of the Druid cluster. For a general explanation of how rules are written, we refer to the OPA documentation. Inside your rule you will have access to input from Druid. Druid provides this data to you to base your policy decisions on: { \"user\": \"someUsername\", (1) \"action\": \"READ\", (2) \"resource\": { \"type\": \"DATASOURCE\", (3) \"name\": \"myTable\" (4) } } 1 The authenticated identity of the user that wants to perform the action 2 The action type, can be either READ or WRITE. 3 The resource type, one of STATE, CONFIG and DATASOURCE. 4 In case of a datasource this is the table name, for STATE this will simply be STATE, the same for CONFIG. For more details consult the Druid Authentication and Authorization Model. The operator creates a ConfigMap with the name of the cluster which contains connection information. Following our example above (the name of the cluster is simple-druid) a ConfigMap with the name simple-druid will be created containing 3 keys: DRUID_ROUTER with the format :, which points to the router processes HTTP endpoint. Here you can connect to the web UI, or use REST endpoints such as /druid/v2/sql/ to query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_AVATICA_JDBC contains a JDBC connect string which can be used together with the Avatica JDBC Driver to connect to Druid and query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_SQALCHEMY contains a connection string used to connect to Druid with SQAlchemy, in - for example - Apache Superset. The managed Druid instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the runtime.properties. For example, if you want to set the druid.server.http.numThreads for the router to 100 adapt the routers section of the cluster resource like so: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: routers: configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Druid Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: routers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1","title":"Usage","component":"druid","version":"0.1","name":"usage","url":"/druid/0.1/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup Prerequisites","hash":"_setup_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Zookeeper operator","hash":"_zookeeper_operator","id":2},{"text":"HDFS operator (optional)","hash":"_hdfs_operator_optional","id":3},{"text":"SQL Database","hash":"_sql_database","id":4},{"text":"Creating a Druid Cluster","hash":"_creating_a_druid_cluster","id":5},{"text":"Using S3","hash":"_using_s3","id":6},{"text":"S3 for ingestion","hash":"_s3_for_ingestion","id":7},{"text":"S3 deep storage","hash":"_s3_deep_storage","id":8},{"text":"Using Open Policy Agent (OPA) for Authorization","hash":"_using_open_policy_agent_opa_for_authorization","id":9},{"text":"Defining RegoRules","hash":"_defining_regorules","id":10},{"text":"Connecting to Druid from other Services","hash":"_connecting_to_druid_from_other_services","id":11},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":12},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":13},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":14},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":15}]},"133":{"id":133,"text":"Default value: /etc/stackable/druid-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-druid-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-druid-operator run --watch-namespace test","title":"","component":"druid","version":"0.2","name":"commandline_args","url":"/druid/0.2/commandline_args.html","titles":[{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":1},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":2}]},"134":{"id":134,"text":"This operator accepts the following command line parameters: Default value: /etc/stackable/druid-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-druid-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-druid-operator run --watch-namespace test This operator accepts the following environment variables: Default value: /etc/stackable/druid-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false export PRODUCT_CONFIG=/foo/bar/properties.yaml stackable-druid-operator run or via docker: docker run \\ --name druid-operator \\ --network host \\ --env KUBECONFIG=/home/stackable/.kube/config \\ --env PRODUCT_CONFIG=/my/product/config.yaml \\ --mount type=bind,source=\"$HOME/.kube/config\",target=\"/home/stackable/.kube/config\" \\ docker.stackable.tech/stackable/druid-operator:latest Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: export WATCH_NAMESPACE=test stackable-druid-operator run or via docker: docker run \\ --name druid-operator \\ --network host \\ --env KUBECONFIG=/home/stackable/.kube/config \\ --env WATCH_NAMESPACE=test \\ --mount type=bind,source=\"$HOME/.kube/config\",target=\"/home/stackable/.kube/config\" \\ docker.stackable.tech/stackable/druid-operator:latest","title":"Configuration","component":"druid","version":"0.2","name":"configuration","url":"/druid/0.2/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Command Line Parameters","hash":"_command_line_parameters","id":1},{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":2},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":3},{"text":"Environment variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"PRODUCT_CONFIG","hash":"_product_config_2","id":5},{"text":"WATCH_NAMESPACE","hash":"_watch_namespace_2","id":6}]},"135":{"id":135,"text":"The Stackable Operator for Apache Druid publishes a discovery ConfigMap, which exposes a client configuration bundle that allows access to the Apache Druid cluster.

This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. The Router is hosting the web UI, a NodePort service is created by the operator to access the web UI. Connect to the simple-druid-router NodePort service and follow the druid documentation on how to load and query sample data. The Stackable Platform uses a common set of resource definitions for s3 across all operators. In general, you can configure an S3 connection or bucket inline, or as a reference to a dedicated object. In Druid, S3 can be used for two things: Ingesting data from a bucket Using it as a backend for deep storage You can specify just a connection/bucket for just one of these or for both, but Druid only supports a single S3 connection under the hood, so if two connections are specified, they must be the same. This is easiest if a dedicated S3 Connection Resource is used - not defined inline but as a dedicated object. TLS for S3 is not yet supported. To ingest data from s3, you need to specify at least a host to connect to, but there are more settings that can be set: spec: ingestion: s3connection: host: yourhost.com (1) port: 80 # optional (2) credentials: # optional (3) ... 1 The S3 host, not optional 2 Port, optional, defaults to 80 3 Credentials to use. Since these might be bucket-dependent, they can instead be given in the ingestion job. Specifying the credentials here is explained below. Druid can use S3 as a backend for deep storage: spec: deepStorage: s3: inline: bucketName: my-bucket (1) connection: inline: host: test-minio (2) port: 9000 (3) credentials: (4) ... 1 Bucket name. 2 Bucket host. 3 Optional bucket port. 4 Credentials explained below. It is also possible to configure the bucket connection details as a separate Kubernetes resource and only refer to that object from the DruidCluster like this: spec: deepStorage: s3: reference: my-bucket-resource (1) 1 Name of the bucket resource with connection details. The resource named my-bucket-resource is then defined as shown below: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Bucket metadata: name: my-bucket-resource spec: bucketName: my-bucket-name connection: inline: host: test-minio port: 9000 credentials: ... (explained below) This has the advantage that bucket configuration can be shared across `DruidClusters`s (and other stackable CRDs) and reduces the cost of updating these details. No matter if a connection is specified inline or as a separate object, the credentials are always specified in the same way. You will need a Secret containing the access key ID and secret access key, a SecretClass and then a reference to this SecretClass where you want to specify the credentials. The Secret: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: s3-credentials labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: s3-credentials-class (1) stringData: accessKey: YOUR_VALID_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE secretKey: YOUR_SECRET_ACCES_KEY_THATBELONGS_TO_THE_KEY_ID_HERE 1 This label connects the Secret to the SecretClass. The SecretClass: apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SecretClass metadata: name: s3-credentials-class spec: backend: k8sSearch: searchNamespace: pod: {} Referencing it: ... credentials: secretClass: s3-credentials-class ... Druid can connect to an Open Policy Agent (OPA) instance for authorization policy decisions. You need to run an OPA instance to connect to, for which we refer to the OPA Operator docs. How you can write RegoRules for Druid is explained below. Once you have defined your rules, you need to configure the OPA cluster name and endpoint to use for Druid authorization requests. Add a section to the spec for OPA: opa: configMapName: simple-opa (1) package: my-druid-rules (2) 1 The name of your OPA cluster (simple-opa in this case) 2 The RegoRule package to use for policy decisions. The package should contain an allow rule. This is optional and will default to the name of the Druid cluster. For a general explanation of how rules are written, we refer to the OPA documentation. Inside your rule you will have access to input from Druid. Druid provides this data to you to base your policy decisions on: { \"user\": \"someUsername\", (1) \"action\": \"READ\", (2) \"resource\": { \"type\": \"DATASOURCE\", (3) \"name\": \"myTable\" (4) } } 1 The authenticated identity of the user that wants to perform the action 2 The action type, can be either READ or WRITE. 3 The resource type, one of STATE, CONFIG and DATASOURCE. 4 In case of a datasource this is the table name, for STATE this will simply be STATE, the same for CONFIG. For more details consult the Druid Authentication and Authorization Model. The operator creates a ConfigMap with the name of the cluster which contains connection information. Following our example above (the name of the cluster is simple-druid) a ConfigMap with the name simple-druid will be created containing 3 keys: DRUID_ROUTER with the format :, which points to the router processes HTTP endpoint. Here you can connect to the web UI, or use REST endpoints such as /druid/v2/sql/ to query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_AVATICA_JDBC contains a JDBC connect string which can be used together with the Avatica JDBC Driver to connect to Druid and query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_SQALCHEMY contains a connection string used to connect to Druid with SQAlchemy, in - for example - Apache Superset. The managed Druid instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the runtime.properties. For example, if you want to set the druid.server.http.numThreads for the router to 100 adapt the routers section of the cluster resource like so: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: routers: configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Druid Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: routers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1","title":"Usage","component":"druid","version":"0.6","name":"usage","url":"/druid/0.6/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup Prerequisites","hash":"_setup_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Zookeeper operator","hash":"_zookeeper_operator","id":2},{"text":"HDFS operator (optional)","hash":"_hdfs_operator_optional","id":3},{"text":"SQL Database","hash":"_sql_database","id":4},{"text":"Creating a Druid Cluster","hash":"_creating_a_druid_cluster","id":5},{"text":"Using S3","hash":"_using_s3","id":6},{"text":"S3 for ingestion","hash":"_s3_for_ingestion","id":7},{"text":"S3 deep storage","hash":"_s3_deep_storage","id":8},{"text":"S3 Credentials","hash":"_s3_credentials","id":9},{"text":"Using Open Policy Agent (OPA) for Authorization","hash":"_using_open_policy_agent_opa_for_authorization","id":10},{"text":"Defining RegoRules","hash":"_defining_regorules","id":11},{"text":"Connecting to Druid from other Services","hash":"_connecting_to_druid_from_other_services","id":12},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":13},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":14},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":15},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":16}]},"147":{"id":147,"text":"Default value: /etc/stackable/druid-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-druid-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-druid-operator run --watch-namespace test","title":"","component":"druid","version":"0.7","name":"commandline_args","url":"/druid/stable/commandline_args.html","titles":[{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":1},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":2}]},"148":{"id":148,"text":"This operator accepts the following command line parameters: Default value: /etc/stackable/druid-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-druid-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-druid-operator run --watch-namespace test This operator accepts the following environment variables: Default value: /etc/stackable/druid-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false export PRODUCT_CONFIG=/foo/bar/properties.yaml stackable-druid-operator run or via docker: docker run \\ --name druid-operator \\ --network host \\ --env KUBECONFIG=/home/stackable/.kube/config \\ --env PRODUCT_CONFIG=/my/product/config.yaml \\ --mount type=bind,source=\"$HOME/.kube/config\",target=\"/home/stackable/.kube/config\" \\ docker.stackable.tech/stackable/druid-operator:latest Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: export WATCH_NAMESPACE=test stackable-druid-operator run or via docker: docker run \\ --name druid-operator \\ --network host \\ --env KUBECONFIG=/home/stackable/.kube/config \\ --env WATCH_NAMESPACE=test \\ --mount type=bind,source=\"$HOME/.kube/config\",target=\"/home/stackable/.kube/config\" \\ docker.stackable.tech/stackable/druid-operator:latest","title":"Configuration","component":"druid","version":"0.7","name":"configuration","url":"/druid/stable/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Command Line Parameters","hash":"_command_line_parameters","id":1},{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":2},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":3},{"text":"Environment variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"PRODUCT_CONFIG","hash":"_product_config_2","id":5},{"text":"WATCH_NAMESPACE","hash":"_watch_namespace_2","id":6}]},"149":{"id":149,"text":"The Stackable Operator for Apache Druid publishes a discovery ConfigMap, which exposes a client configuration bundle that allows access to the Apache Druid cluster.

Add a section to the spec for OPA: opa: configMapName: simple-opa (1) package: my-druid-rules (2) 1 The name of your OPA cluster (simple-opa in this case) 2 The RegoRule package to use for policy decisions. The package should contain an allow rule. This is optional and will default to the name of the Druid cluster. For a general explanation of how rules are written, we refer to the OPA documentation. Inside your rule you will have access to input from Druid. Druid provides this data to you to base your policy decisions on: { \"user\": \"someUsername\", (1) \"action\": \"READ\", (2) \"resource\": { \"type\": \"DATASOURCE\", (3) \"name\": \"myTable\" (4) } } 1 The authenticated identity of the user that wants to perform the action 2 The action type, can be either READ or WRITE. 3 The resource type, one of STATE, CONFIG and DATASOURCE. 4 In case of a datasource this is the table name, for STATE this will simply be STATE, the same for CONFIG. For more details consult the Druid Authentication and Authorization Model. The operator creates a ConfigMap with the name of the cluster which contains connection information. Following our example above (the name of the cluster is simple-druid) a ConfigMap with the name simple-druid will be created containing 3 keys: DRUID_ROUTER with the format :, which points to the router processes HTTP endpoint. Here you can connect to the web UI, or use REST endpoints such as /druid/v2/sql/ to query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_AVATICA_JDBC contains a JDBC connect string which can be used together with the Avatica JDBC Driver to connect to Druid and query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_SQALCHEMY contains a connection string used to connect to Druid with SQAlchemy, in - for example - Apache Superset. The managed Druid instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the runtime.properties. For example, if you want to set the druid.server.http.numThreads for the router to 100 adapt the routers section of the cluster resource like so: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: routers: configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Druid Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: routers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1","title":"Usage","component":"druid","version":"0.7","name":"usage","url":"/druid/stable/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup Prerequisites","hash":"_setup_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Zookeeper operator","hash":"_zookeeper_operator","id":2},{"text":"HDFS operator (optional)","hash":"_hdfs_operator_optional","id":3},{"text":"SQL Database","hash":"_sql_database","id":4},{"text":"Creating a Druid Cluster","hash":"_creating_a_druid_cluster","id":5},{"text":"Using S3","hash":"_using_s3","id":6},{"text":"S3 for ingestion","hash":"_s3_for_ingestion","id":7},{"text":"S3 deep storage","hash":"_s3_deep_storage","id":8},{"text":"S3 Credentials","hash":"_s3_credentials","id":9},{"text":"HDFS deep storage","hash":"_hdfs_deep_storage","id":10},{"text":"Using Open Policy Agent (OPA) for Authorization","hash":"_using_open_policy_agent_opa_for_authorization","id":11},{"text":"Defining RegoRules","hash":"_defining_regorules","id":12},{"text":"Connecting to Druid from other Services","hash":"_connecting_to_druid_from_other_services","id":13},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":14},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":15},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":16},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":17}]},"153":{"id":153,"text":"After going through the Installation section and having installed all the Operators, you will now deploy a Druid cluster and it’s dependencies.

This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. The Router is hosting the web UI, a NodePort service is created by the operator to access the web UI. Connect to the simple-druid-router NodePort service and follow the druid documentation on how to load and query sample data. The Stackable Platform uses a common set of resource definitions for s3 across all operators. In general, you can configure an S3 connection or bucket inline, or as a reference to a dedicated object. In Druid, S3 can be used for two things: Ingesting data from a bucket Using it as a backend for deep storage You can specify just a connection/bucket for just one of these or for both, but Druid only supports a single S3 connection under the hood, so if two connections are specified, they must be the same. This is easiest if a dedicated S3 Connection Resource is used - not defined inline but as a dedicated object. TLS for S3 is not yet supported. To ingest data from s3, you need to specify at least a host to connect to, but there are more settings that can be set: spec: ingestion: s3connection: host: yourhost.com (1) port: 80 # optional (2) credentials: # optional (3) ... 1 The S3 host, not optional 2 Port, optional, defaults to 80 3 Credentials to use. Since these might be bucket-dependent, they can instead be given in the ingestion job. Specifying the credentials here is explained below. Druid can use S3 as a backend for deep storage: spec: deepStorage: s3: bucket: inline: bucketName: my-bucket (1) connection: inline: host: test-minio (2) port: 9000 (3) credentials: (4) ... 1 Bucket name. 2 Bucket host. 3 Optional bucket port. 4 Credentials explained below. It is also possible to configure the bucket connection details as a separate Kubernetes resource and only refer to that object from the DruidCluster like this: spec: deepStorage: s3: bucket: reference: my-bucket-resource (1) 1 Name of the bucket resource with connection details. The resource named my-bucket-resource is then defined as shown below: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Bucket metadata: name: my-bucket-resource spec: bucketName: my-bucket-name connection: inline: host: test-minio port: 9000 credentials: ... (explained below) This has the advantage that bucket configuration can be shared across `DruidClusters`s (and other stackable CRDs) and reduces the cost of updating these details. No matter if a connection is specified inline or as a separate object, the credentials are always specified in the same way. You will need a Secret containing the access key ID and secret access key, a SecretClass and then a reference to this SecretClass where you want to specify the credentials. The Secret: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: s3-credentials labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: s3-credentials-class (1) stringData: accessKey: YOUR_VALID_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE secretKey: YOUR_SECRET_ACCES_KEY_THATBELONGS_TO_THE_KEY_ID_HERE 1 This label connects the Secret to the SecretClass. The SecretClass: apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SecretClass metadata: name: s3-credentials-class spec: backend: k8sSearch: searchNamespace: pod: {} Referencing it: ... credentials: secretClass: s3-credentials-class ... Druid can use HDFS as a backend for deep storage: spec: deepStorage: hdfs: configMapName: simple-hdfs (1) directory: /druid (2) ... 1 Name of the HDFS cluster discovery config map. Can be supplied manually for a cluster not provided by Stackable. Needs to contain the core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml. 2 The directory where to store the druid data. Druid can connect to an Open Policy Agent (OPA) instance for authorization policy decisions. You need to run an OPA instance to connect to, for which we refer to the OPA Operator docs. How you can write RegoRules for Druid is explained below. Once you have defined your rules, you need to configure the OPA cluster name and endpoint to use for Druid authorization requests. Add a section to the spec for OPA: opa: configMapName: simple-opa (1) package: my-druid-rules (2) 1 The name of your OPA cluster (simple-opa in this case) 2 The RegoRule package to use for policy decisions. The package should contain an allow rule. This is optional and will default to the name of the Druid cluster. For a general explanation of how rules are written, we refer to the OPA documentation. Inside your rule you will have access to input from Druid. Druid provides this data to you to base your policy decisions on: { \"user\": \"someUsername\", (1) \"action\": \"READ\", (2) \"resource\": { \"type\": \"DATASOURCE\", (3) \"name\": \"myTable\" (4) } } 1 The authenticated identity of the user that wants to perform the action 2 The action type, can be either READ or WRITE. 3 The resource type, one of STATE, CONFIG and DATASOURCE. 4 In case of a datasource this is the table name, for STATE this will simply be STATE, the same for CONFIG. For more details consult the Druid Authentication and Authorization Model. The operator creates a ConfigMap with the name of the cluster which contains connection information. Following our example above (the name of the cluster is simple-druid) a ConfigMap with the name simple-druid will be created containing 3 keys: DRUID_ROUTER with the format :, which points to the router processes HTTP endpoint. Here you can connect to the web UI, or use REST endpoints such as /druid/v2/sql/ to query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_AVATICA_JDBC contains a JDBC connect string which can be used together with the Avatica JDBC Driver to connect to Druid and query data. More information in the Druid Docs. DRUID_SQALCHEMY contains a connection string used to connect to Druid with SQAlchemy, in - for example - Apache Superset. The managed Druid instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the HTTP port) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the runtime.properties. For example, if you want to set the druid.server.http.numThreads for the router to 100 adapt the routers section of the cluster resource like so: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: routers: configOverrides: runtime.properties: druid.server.http.numThreads: \"100\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Druid Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: routers: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: routers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 Druid uses S3 or HDFS deep storage, so no extra PersistentVolumeClaims have to be specified. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role or role group, where the role group configuration overrides existing parts (otherwise they will be inherited) from the role configuration: brokers: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '3Gi' In this example, each Druid broker in the default group will have a maximum of 3Gi (gigabytes) of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the container running Druid but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Not specifying any memory limits in the role group will use the provided 2Gi from the role. If the role is not specified it will use defaults as demonstrated below. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' If nothing is specified, the operator will automatically set the following default values for resources: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: min: '200m' max: \"4\" memory: limit: '2Gi' The default values are most likely not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements.

Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of HBase which you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. The managed HBase instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the following files: hbase-site.xml hbase-env.sh For example, if you want to set the hbase.rest.threads.min to 4 and the HBASE_HEAPSIZE to two GB adapt the restServers section of the cluster resource like so: restServers: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: hbase-site.xml: hbase.rest.threads.min: \"4\" hbase-env.sh: HBASE_HEAPSIZE: \"2G\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: restServers: configOverrides: hbase-site.xml: hbase.rest.threads.min: \"4\" hbase-env.sh: HBASE_HEAPSIZE: \"2G\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings.

Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of HBase which you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. The managed HBase instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the following files: hbase-site.xml hbase-env.sh For example, if you want to set the hbase.rest.threads.min to 4 and the HBASE_HEAPSIZE to two GB adapt the restServers section of the cluster resource like so: restServers: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: hbase-site.xml: hbase.rest.threads.min: \"4\" hbase-env.sh: HBASE_HEAPSIZE: \"2G\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: restServers: configOverrides: hbase-site.xml: hbase.rest.threads.min: \"4\" hbase-env.sh: HBASE_HEAPSIZE: \"2G\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. The properties will be formatted and escaped correctly into the XML file, respectively inserted as is into the env.sh file. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the HBase Configuration Documentation. The Apache Phoenix project provides the ability to interact with HBase with JBDC using familiar SQL-syntax. The Phoenix dependencies are bundled with the Stackable HBase image and do not need to be installed separately (client components will need to ensure that they have the correct client-side libraries available). Information about client-side installation can be found here. Phoenix comes bundled with a few simple scripts to verify a correct server-side installation. For example, assuming that phoenix dependencies have been installed to their default location of /stackable/phoenix/bin, we can issue the following using the supplied psql.py script: /stackable/phoenix/bin/psql.py && \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT.sql && \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT.csv && \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT_QUERIES.sql This script creates a java command that creates, populates and queries a Phoenix table called WEB_STAT. Alternatively, one can use the sqlline.py script (which wraps the sqlline utility): /stackable/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py [zookeeper] [sql file] The script opens an SQL prompt from where one can list, query, create and generally interact with Phoenix tables. So, to query the table that was created in the previous step, start the script and enter some SQL at the prompt: The Phoenix table WEB_STAT is created as an HBase table, and can be viewed normally from within the HBase UI: The SYSTEM* tables are those required by Phoenix and are created the first time that Phoenix is invoked. Both psql.py and sqlline.py generate a java command that calls classes from the Phoenix client library .jar.

To deploy a ZooKeeper cluster create one file called zk.yaml: --- apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: ZookeeperCluster metadata: name: simple-zk spec: version: 3.8.0-stackable0.7.1 servers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 We also need to define a ZNode that will be used by the HDFS and HBase clusters to reference ZooKeeper.

This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. Create the actual HDFS cluster by applying the file: kubectl apply -f hdfs.yaml Track the progress with kubectl as this step may take a few minutes: kubectl rollout status --watch statefulset/simple-hdfs-datanode-default kubectl rollout status --watch statefulset/simple-hdfs-namenode-default kubectl rollout status --watch statefulset/simple-hdfs-journalnode-default You can now create the HBase cluster. Create a file called hbase.yaml containing the following: --- apiVersion: hbase.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HbaseCluster metadata: name: simple-hbase spec: version: 2.4.12-stackable0.2.0 hdfsConfigMapName: simple-hdfs zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-znode config: hbaseRootdir: /hbase masters: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 regionServers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 restServers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 To test the cluster you will use the REST API to check its version and status, and to create and inspect a new table. You will also use Phoenix to create, populate and query a second new table, before listing all non-system tables in HBase. These actions wil be carried out from one of the HBase components, the REST server. First, check the cluster version with this callout: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 -- \\ curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/version/cluster\" This will return the version that was specified in the HBase cluster definition: {\"Version\":\"2.4.12\"} The cluster status can be checked and formatted like this: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/status/cluster\" | json_pp which will display cluster metadata that looks like this (only the first region is included for the sake of readability): { \"DeadNodes\" : [], \"LiveNodes\" : [ { \"Region\" : [ { \"currentCompactedKVs\" : 0, \"memStoreSizeMB\" : 0, \"name\" : \"U1lTVEVNLkNBVEFMT0csLDE2NjExNjA0NDM2NjcuYmYwMzA1YmM4ZjFmOGIwZWMwYjhmMGNjMWI5N2RmMmUu\", \"readRequestsCount\" : 104, \"rootIndexSizeKB\" : 1, \"storefileIndexSizeKB\" : 1, \"storefileSizeMB\" : 1, \"storefiles\" : 1, \"stores\" : 1, \"totalCompactingKVs\" : 0, \"totalStaticBloomSizeKB\" : 0, \"totalStaticIndexSizeKB\" : 1, \"writeRequestsCount\" : 360 }, ... ], \"heapSizeMB\" : 351, \"maxHeapSizeMB\" : 11978, \"name\" : \"simple-hbase-regionserver-default-0.simple-hbase-regionserver-default.default.svc.cluster.local:16020\", \"requests\" : 395, \"startCode\" : 1661156787704 } ], \"averageLoad\" : 43, \"regions\" : 43, \"requests\" : 1716 } You can now create a table like this: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XPUT -H \"Accept: text/xml\" -H \"Content-Type: text/xml\" \\ \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/users/schema\" \\ -d '' This will create a table users with a single column family cf. Its creation can be verified by listing it: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/users/schema\" | json_pp { \"table\" : [ { \"name\" : \"users\" } ] } An alternative way to interact with HBase is to use the Phoenix library that is pre-installed on the Stackable HBase image (in the /stackable/phoenix directory). Use the python utility psql.py (found in /stackable/phoenix/bin) to create, populate and query a table called WEB_STAT: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 -- \\ /stackable/phoenix/bin/psql.py \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT.sql \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT.csv \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT_QUERIES.sql The final command will display some grouped data like this: HO TOTAL_ACTIVE_VISITORS -- ---------------------------------------- EU 150 NA 1 Time: 0.017 sec(s) Check the tables again with: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/users/schema\" | json_pp This time the list includes not just users (created above with the REST API) and WEB_STAT, but several other tables too: { \"table\" : [ { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.CATALOG\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.CHILD_LINK\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.FUNCTION\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.LOG\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.MUTEX\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.SEQUENCE\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.STATS\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.TASK\" }, { \"name\" : \"WEB_STAT\" }, { \"name\" : \"users\" } ] } This is because Phoenix requires these SYSTEM. tables for its own internal mapping mechanism, and they are created the first time that Phoenix is used on the cluster.

For a full list of configuration options we refer to the HBase Configuration Documentation. The HBase Operator currently does not support any PersistentVolumeClaims. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role or role group, where the role group configuration overrides existing parts (otherwise they will be inherited) from the role configuration: regionServers: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '3Gi' In this example, each HBase region server in the default group will have a maximum of 3Gi (gigabytes) of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the container running HBase but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Not specifying any memory limits in the role group will use the provided 2Gi from the role. If the role is not specified it will use defaults as demonstrated below. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: regionServers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' If nothing is specified, the operator will automatically set the following default values for resources: regionServers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: min: '200m' max: \"4\" memory: limit: '2Gi' The default values are most likely not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements. For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.

Create a file named hdfs.yaml defining 2 namenodes and one datanode and journalnode each: --- apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HdfsCluster metadata: name: simple-hdfs spec: version: 3.3.3-stackable0.1.0 zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-znode dfsReplication: 3 nameNodes: roleGroups: default: replicas: 2 dataNodes: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 journalNodes: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 Where: metadata.name contains the name of the HDFS cluster the label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in spec.version Please note that the version you need to specify for spec.version is not only the version of Hadoop which you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. Create the actual HDFS cluster by applying the file: kubectl apply -f hdfs.yaml Track the progress with kubectl as this step may take a few minutes: kubectl rollout status --watch statefulset/simple-hdfs-datanode-default kubectl rollout status --watch statefulset/simple-hdfs-namenode-default kubectl rollout status --watch statefulset/simple-hdfs-journalnode-default You can now create the HBase cluster. Create a file called hbase.yaml containing the following: --- apiVersion: hbase.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: HbaseCluster metadata: name: simple-hbase spec: version: 2.4.12-stackable0.2.0 hdfsConfigMapName: simple-hdfs zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-znode config: hbaseRootdir: /hbase masters: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 regionServers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: min: 300m max: \"3\" memory: limit: 3Gi replicas: 1 restServers: roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 To test the cluster you will use the REST API to check its version and status, and to create and inspect a new table. You will also use Phoenix to create, populate and query a second new table, before listing all non-system tables in HBase. These actions wil be carried out from one of the HBase components, the REST server. First, check the cluster version with this callout: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 -- \\ curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/version/cluster\" This will return the version that was specified in the HBase cluster definition: {\"Version\":\"2.4.12\"} The cluster status can be checked and formatted like this: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/status/cluster\" | json_pp which will display cluster metadata that looks like this (only the first region is included for the sake of readability): { \"DeadNodes\" : [], \"LiveNodes\" : [ { \"Region\" : [ { \"currentCompactedKVs\" : 0, \"memStoreSizeMB\" : 0, \"name\" : \"U1lTVEVNLkNBVEFMT0csLDE2NjExNjA0NDM2NjcuYmYwMzA1YmM4ZjFmOGIwZWMwYjhmMGNjMWI5N2RmMmUu\", \"readRequestsCount\" : 104, \"rootIndexSizeKB\" : 1, \"storefileIndexSizeKB\" : 1, \"storefileSizeMB\" : 1, \"storefiles\" : 1, \"stores\" : 1, \"totalCompactingKVs\" : 0, \"totalStaticBloomSizeKB\" : 0, \"totalStaticIndexSizeKB\" : 1, \"writeRequestsCount\" : 360 }, ... ], \"heapSizeMB\" : 351, \"maxHeapSizeMB\" : 11978, \"name\" : \"simple-hbase-regionserver-default-0.simple-hbase-regionserver-default.default.svc.cluster.local:16020\", \"requests\" : 395, \"startCode\" : 1661156787704 } ], \"averageLoad\" : 43, \"regions\" : 43, \"requests\" : 1716 } You can now create a table like this: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XPUT -H \"Accept: text/xml\" -H \"Content-Type: text/xml\" \\ \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/users/schema\" \\ -d '' This will create a table users with a single column family cf. Its creation can be verified by listing it: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/users/schema\" | json_pp { \"table\" : [ { \"name\" : \"users\" } ] } An alternative way to interact with HBase is to use the Phoenix library that is pre-installed on the Stackable HBase image (in the /stackable/phoenix directory). Use the python utility psql.py (found in /stackable/phoenix/bin) to create, populate and query a table called WEB_STAT: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 -- \\ /stackable/phoenix/bin/psql.py \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT.sql \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT.csv \\ /stackable/phoenix/examples/WEB_STAT_QUERIES.sql The final command will display some grouped data like this: HO TOTAL_ACTIVE_VISITORS -- ---------------------------------------- EU 150 NA 1 Time: 0.017 sec(s) Check the tables again with: kubectl exec -n default simple-hbase-restserver-default-0 \\ -- curl -s -XGET -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"http://simple-hbase-restserver-default:8080/users/schema\" | json_pp This time the list includes not just users (created above with the REST API) and WEB_STAT, but several other tables too: { \"table\" : [ { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.CATALOG\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.CHILD_LINK\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.FUNCTION\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.LOG\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.MUTEX\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.SEQUENCE\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.STATS\" }, { \"name\" : \"SYSTEM.TASK\" }, { \"name\" : \"WEB_STAT\" }, { \"name\" : \"users\" } ] } This is because Phoenix requires these SYSTEM. tables for its own internal mapping mechanism, and they are created the first time that Phoenix is used on the cluster.

The managed HDFS instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties can lead to faulty clusters. In general this means, do not change ports, hostnames or properties related to data dirs, high-availability or security. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify configOverrides for the hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml. For example, if you want to set additional properties on the namenode servers, adapt the nameNodes section of the cluster resource like so: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: [...] configOverrides: core-site.xml: fs.trash.interval: \"5\" hdfs-site.xml: dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: \"3\" replicas: 2 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: nameNodes: configOverrides: core-site.xml: fs.trash.interval: \"5\" hdfs-site.xml: dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: \"3\" roleGroups: default: config: [...] replicas: 2 All override property values must be strings. The properties will be formatted and escaped correctly into the XML file. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache Hdfs documentation for hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: nameNodes: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 Some environment variables will be overriden by the operator and cannot be set manually by the user. These are HADOOP_HOME, HADOOP_CONF_DIR, POD_NAME and ZOOKEEPER. You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifiying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: dataNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 128Gi In the above example, all data nodes in the default group will store data (the location of dfs.datanode.name.dir) on a 128Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each namenode container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 64 megabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the name node daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the namenod’s pod. Setting this property will automatically also set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: dataNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"hdfs","version":"0.4","name":"usage","url":"/hdfs/0.4/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":1},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":2},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":3},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":5},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":6},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":7}]},"198":{"id":198,"text":"Default value: /etc/stackable/hdfs-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-hdfs-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-hdfs-operator run --watch-namespace test","title":"","component":"hdfs","version":"0.5","name":"commandline_args","url":"/hdfs/stable/commandline_args.html","titles":[{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":1},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":2}]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"This operator accepts the following command line parameters: Default value: /etc/stackable/hdfs-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-hdfs-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-hdfs-operator run --watch-namespace test This operator accepts the following environment variables: Default value: /etc/stackable/hdfs-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false export PRODUCT_CONFIG=/foo/bar/properties.yaml stackable-hdfs-operator run or via docker: docker run \\ --name hdfs-operator \\ --network host \\ --env KUBECONFIG=/home/stackable/.kube/config \\ --env PRODUCT_CONFIG=/my/product/config.yaml \\ --mount type=bind,source=\"$HOME/.kube/config\",target=\"/home/stackable/.kube/config\" \\ docker.stackable.tech/stackable/hdfs-operator:latest Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: export WATCH_NAMESPACE=test stackable-hdfs-operator run or via docker: docker run \\ --name hdfs-operator \\ --network host \\ --env KUBECONFIG=/home/stackable/.kube/config \\ --env WATCH_NAMESPACE=test \\ --mount type=bind,source=\"$HOME/.kube/config\",target=\"/home/stackable/.kube/config\" \\ docker.stackable.tech/stackable/hdfs-operator:latest","title":"Configuration","component":"hdfs","version":"0.5","name":"configuration","url":"/hdfs/stable/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Command Line Parameters","hash":"_command_line_parameters","id":1},{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":2},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":3},{"text":"Environment variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"PRODUCT_CONFIG","hash":"_product_config_2","id":5},{"text":"WATCH_NAMESPACE","hash":"_watch_namespace_2","id":6}]},"200":{"id":200,"text":"The Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS publishes a discovery ConfigMap, which exposes a client configuration bundle that allows access to the Apache HDFS cluster.

The managed HDFS instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties can lead to faulty clusters. In general this means, do not change ports, hostnames or properties related to data dirs, high-availability or security. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify configOverrides for the hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml. For example, if you want to set additional properties on the namenode servers, adapt the nameNodes section of the cluster resource like so: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: [...] configOverrides: core-site.xml: fs.trash.interval: \"5\" hdfs-site.xml: dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: \"3\" replicas: 2 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: nameNodes: configOverrides: core-site.xml: fs.trash.interval: \"5\" hdfs-site.xml: dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: \"3\" roleGroups: default: config: [...] replicas: 2 All override property values must be strings. The properties will be formatted and escaped correctly into the XML file. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache Hdfs documentation for hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: nameNodes: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 Some environment variables will be overriden by the operator and cannot be set manually by the user. These are HADOOP_HOME, HADOOP_CONF_DIR, POD_NAME and ZOOKEEPER. You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifiying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: dataNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 128Gi In the above example, all data nodes in the default group will store data (the location of dfs.datanode.name.dir) on a 128Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each namenode container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 64 megabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the name node daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the namenod’s pod. Setting this property will automatically also set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: dataNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"hdfs","version":"0.5","name":"usage","url":"/hdfs/stable/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":1},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":2},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":3},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":5},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":6},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":7}]},"205":{"id":205,"text":"Once you have followed the steps in the Installation section to install the operator and its dependencies, you will now deploy an HDFS cluster and its dependencies.

The managed HDFS instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties can lead to faulty clusters. In general this means, do not change ports, hostnames or properties related to data dirs, high-availability or security. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify configOverrides for the hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml. For example, if you want to set additional properties on the namenode servers, adapt the nameNodes section of the cluster resource like so: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: [...] configOverrides: core-site.xml: fs.trash.interval: \"5\" hdfs-site.xml: dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: \"3\" replicas: 2 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: nameNodes: configOverrides: core-site.xml: fs.trash.interval: \"5\" hdfs-site.xml: dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: \"3\" roleGroups: default: config: [...] replicas: 2 All override property values must be strings. The properties will be formatted and escaped correctly into the XML file. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache Hdfs documentation for hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: nameNodes: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 Some environment variables will be overriden by the operator and cannot be set manually by the user. These are HADOOP_HOME, HADOOP_CONF_DIR, POD_NAME and ZOOKEEPER. You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifiying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: dataNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 128Gi In the above example, all data nodes in the default group will store data (the location of dfs.datanode.name.dir) on a 128Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: nameNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each namenode container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 64 megabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the name node daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the namenod’s pod. Setting this property will automatically also set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: dataNodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"hdfs","version":"nightly","name":"usage","url":"/hdfs/nightly/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":1},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":2},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":3},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":4},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":5},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":6},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":7}]},"215":{"id":215,"text":"Once you have followed the steps in the Installation section to install the operator and its dependencies, you will now deploy an HDFS cluster and its dependencies.

Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the ports) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the server.properties. For example, if you want to set the auto.create.topics.enable to disable automatic topic creation, it can be configured in the KafkaCluster resource like so: brokers: roleGroups: default: configOverrides: server.properties: auto.create.topics.enable: \"false\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: brokers: configOverrides: server.properties: auto.create.topics.enable: \"false\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache Kafka Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: servers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: servers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi In the above example, all Kafka brokers in the default group will store data (the location of the property log.dirs) on a 2Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each Kafka container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the Kafka daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"kafka","version":"0.6","name":"usage","url":"/kafka/0.6/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":1},{"text":"Provide log4j.properties","hash":"_provide_log4j_properties","id":2},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":3},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":4},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":5},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":6},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":7},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":8}]},"252":{"id":252,"text":"Default value: /etc/stackable/kafka-operator/config-spec/properties.yaml Required: false Multiple values: false stackable-kafka-operator run --product-config /foo/bar/properties.yaml Default value: All namespaces Required: false Multiple values: false The operator will only watch for resources in the provided namespace test: stackable-kafka-operator run --watch-namespace test","title":"","component":"kafka","version":"0.7","name":"commandline_args","url":"/kafka/stable/commandline_args.html","titles":[{"text":"product-config","hash":"_product_config","id":1},{"text":"watch-namespace","hash":"_watch_namespace","id":2}]},"253":{"id":253,"text":"The cluster can be configured via a YAML file.

This is optional. 2 The referenced AuthenticationClass that references a SecretClass to provide certificates. 3 The reference to a SecretClass. 4 The SecretClass that is referenced by the AuthenticationClass in order to provide certificates. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the ports) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the server.properties. For example, if you want to set the auto.create.topics.enable to disable automatic topic creation, it can be configured in the KafkaCluster resource like so: brokers: roleGroups: default: configOverrides: server.properties: auto.create.topics.enable: \"false\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: brokers: configOverrides: server.properties: auto.create.topics.enable: \"false\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache Kafka Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: servers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: servers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi In the above example, all Kafka brokers in the default group will store data (the location of the property log.dirs) on a 2Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each Kafka container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the Kafka daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"kafka","version":"0.7","name":"usage","url":"/kafka/stable/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":1},{"text":"Provide log4j.properties","hash":"_provide_log4j_properties","id":2},{"text":"Encryption","hash":"_encryption","id":3},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":4},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":5},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":6},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":7},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":8},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":9},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":10}]},"260":{"id":260,"text":"After going through the Installation section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a Kafka cluster and the required dependencies.

This is optional. 2 The referenced AuthenticationClass that references a SecretClass to provide certificates. 3 The reference to a SecretClass. 4 The SecretClass that is referenced by the AuthenticationClass in order to provide certificates. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the ports) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the server.properties. For example, if you want to set the auto.create.topics.enable to disable automatic topic creation, it can be configured in the KafkaCluster resource like so: brokers: roleGroups: default: configOverrides: server.properties: auto.create.topics.enable: \"false\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: brokers: configOverrides: server.properties: auto.create.topics.enable: \"false\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache Kafka Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: servers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: servers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi In the above example, all Kafka brokers in the default group will store data (the location of the property log.dirs) on a 2Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each Kafka container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the Kafka daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: brokers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"kafka","version":"nightly","name":"usage","url":"/kafka/nightly/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":1},{"text":"Provide log4j.properties","hash":"_provide_log4j_properties","id":2},{"text":"Encryption","hash":"_encryption","id":3},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":4},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":5},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":6},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":7},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":8},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":9},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":10}]},"271":{"id":271,"text":"After going through the Installation section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a Kafka cluster and the required dependencies.

You’re now ready to deploy Apache NiFi in Kubernetes. A valid Zookeeper installation must be available and configured accordingly in the custom resource. This operator also requires the Stackable Secret Operator to be present as CSI provider in Kubernetes. The simplest way to install it is to just run: $ helm install secret-operator stackable-dev/secret-operator This Operator is published as a Docker image: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/nifi-operator When installing manually with Docker you will need to install the Stackable CRDs for Apache ZooKeeper in your Kubernetes environment.

See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Do not override port numbers. This will lead to cluster malfunction. Currently, not supported for any file. Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the envOverrides property. For example per role group: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" or per role: nodes: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 By default, a Nifi cluster will create five different persistent volume claims for flow files, provenance, database, content and state folders. These PVCs will request 2Gi. It is recommended that you configure these volume requests according to your needs. Storage requests can be configured at role or group level, for one or more of the persistent volumes as follows: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: flowfile_repo: capacity: 12Gi provenance_repo: capacity: 12Gi database_repo: capacity: 12Gi content_repo: capacity: 12Gi state_repo: capacity: 12Gi In the above example, all nodes in the default group will request 12Gi of storage the various folders. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each node container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2Gi of memory. Setting this property will automatically also set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit.

It is possible to define multiple groups of nodes, each with its own distinct configuration, every roleGroup has the following elements: selector: a Kubernetes Selector to specify criteria that can be used to target nodes config: The NiFi config to use for this group replicas: How many pods to roll out for this group authenticationConfig: method: SingleUser: adminCredentialsSecret: name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple namespace: default allowAnonymousAccess: true All authentication related parameters are configured in the authenticationConfig element. Currently, the only supported authentication method is \"SingleUser\", which allows the definition of one admin user which can then access the cluster. Specification of these users credentials happens via referring to a Secret in Kubernetes, this secret will need to contain at least the two keys username and password. Extra keys may be present, but will be ignored by the operator. NiFi can be configured to allow anonymous access to the web UI, this is turned off by default, but can be enabled via the parameter allowAnonymousAccess. This setting is independent of the configured authentication method and will override anything specified for the authentication provider. zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode NiFi in cluster mode requires a ZooKeeper ensemble for state management and leader election purposes, this operator at the moment does not support single node deployments without ZooKeeper, hence this is a required setting. Configuration happens via a ConfigMap, which needs to contain two keys called ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS with the value being the ZooKeeper connection string and ZOOKEEPER_CHROOT with the value being the ZooKeeper chroot. This ConfigMap typically is created by a ZookeeperZnode of the ZooKeeper Operator. config: sensitivePropertyKeySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key log: rootLogLevel: INFO This is the actual NiFi configuration element. At the moment only a very limited set of options is supported, but you can expect these to grow quickly over time. Anything that is not mentioned here can be configured via configOverrides.

There are multiple options to set up the authentication of users. The default setting is to only provision a single user with administrative privileges. You need to specify the username and password of the user. Further users can not be added. NiFI supports authentication of users against an LDAP server. Have a look at the LDAP test and the general Stackable Authentication documentation on how to set it up. In general, it requires you to specify a AuthenticationClass which is used to authenticate the users. Here you have an example usage --- apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: NifiCluster metadata: name: test-nifi spec: config: authentication: method: authenticationClass: ldap-without-tls --- apiVersion: authentication.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AuthenticationClass metadata: name: ldap-without-tls spec: provider: ldap: hostname: openldap.default.svc.cluster.local searchBase: ou=users,dc=example,dc=org bindCredentials: secretClass: nifi-with-ldap-bind port: 1389 --- apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SecretClass metadata: name: nifi-with-ldap-bind spec: backend: k8sSearch: searchNamespace: pod: {} --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: nifi-with-ldap-bind labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: nifi-with-ldap-bind stringData: user: cn=integrationtest,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org password: integrationtest NiFi supports multiple authorization methods documented here. The available authorization methods depend on the chosen authentication method. Authorization is not fully implemented by the stackable nifi-operator. Because of this the operator currently infers the authorization method to use from the configured authentication method. For this authentication method the Single user authorization will be used. Basically the single user is allowed to do everything. In the future retrieving groups from LDAP and providing policies via OPA is planned. Currently we will use the org.apache.nifi.authorization.FileUserGroupProvider and org.apache.nifi.authorization.FileAccessPolicyProvider. The user specified in the LDAP bind will be the admin user which can log into the NiFi cluster and create and modify other users. He is also able to create and modify groups and polices in the Webinterface. The changes made will be written to local files which are not persistent. The managed NiFi cluster is automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Do not override port numbers. This will lead to cluster malfunction. Apache NiFi runtime configuration is stored in the files bootstrap.conf and nifi.properties. The configOverrides block allows you to add custom parameters to these files. A Full list of the available configuration options can be found in the official Apache NiFi documentation at https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/components/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#system_properties. Overrides consist of a key, which must match the property name in the configuration file and a value. This allows arbitrary configuration properties to be added to Spark. In the example above a property aws.region is being explicitly set to 'eu-west-1', overriding the default value. Please be aware that by overriding config settings in this section you have a very high risk of breaking things, because the product does not behave the way the Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi expects it to behave anymore. The following snippet shows an example of how this would look in the NifiCluster definition: config: sensitivePropertyKeySecret: nifi-sensitive-property- configOverrides: nifi.properties: nifi.config.property: eu-west-1 bootstrap.conf: boostrap.config.property: some_string replicas: 2 Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the envOverrides property.

After you have installed stackablectl, run the following command to install all operators necessary for NiFi: stackablectl operator install \\ commons=0.3.0-nightly \\ secret=0.6.0-nightly \\ zookeeper=0.11.0-nightly \\ nifi=0.7.0-nightly The tool will show [INFO ] Installing commons operator in version 0.3.0-nightly [INFO ] Installing secret operator in version 0.6.0-nightly [INFO ] Installing zookeeper operator in version 0.11.0-nightly [INFO ] Installing nifi operator in version 0.7.0-nightly Consult the Quickstart to learn more about how to use stackablectl. You can also use Helm to install the operators. Add the Stackable Helm repository: helm repo add stackable-dev https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/helm-dev/ Then install the Stackable Operators: helm install --wait commons-operator stackable-dev/commons-operator --version 0.3.0-nightly helm install --wait secret-operator stackable-dev/secret-operator --version 0.6.0-nightly helm install --wait zookeeper-operator stackable-dev/zookeeper-operator --version 0.11.0-nightly helm install --wait nifi-operator stackable-dev/nifi-operator --version 0.7.0-nightly Helm will deploy the operators in a Kubernetes Deployment and apply the CRDs for the Apache NiFi service (as well as the CRDs for the required operators). You are now ready to deploy Apache NiFi in Kubernetes.

This custom resource specifies the amount of replicas for each role group or role specific configuration like port definitions etc. The following listing shows a fairly complete example that sets most available options, for more detail about the individual elements please refer to the table further down on the page. apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: NifiCluster metadata: name: simple-nifi spec: version: 1.16.3-stackable0.1.0 zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode authenticationConfig: method: SingleUser: adminCredentialsSecret: name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple namespace: default allowAnonymousAccess: true nodes: roleGroups: default: selector: matchLabels: kubernetes.io/os: linux config: sensitivePropertyKeySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key log: rootLogLevel: INFO replicas: 3 nodes: roleGroups: default: selector: matchLabels: kubernetes.io/os: linux config: replicas: 3 The nodes element is used to define how many pods with which configuration should be rolled out. It is possible to define multiple groups of nodes, each with its own distinct configuration, every roleGroup has the following elements: selector: a Kubernetes Selector to specify criteria that can be used to target nodes config: The NiFi config to use for this group replicas: How many pods to roll out for this group authenticationConfig: method: SingleUser: adminCredentialsSecret: name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple namespace: default allowAnonymousAccess: true All authentication related parameters are configured in the authenticationConfig element. Currently, the only supported authentication method is \"SingleUser\", which allows the definition of one admin user which can then access the cluster. Specification of these users credentials happens via referring to a Secret in Kubernetes, this secret will need to contain at least the two keys username and password. Extra keys may be present, but will be ignored by the operator. NiFi can be configured to allow anonymous access to the web UI, this is turned off by default, but can be enabled via the parameter allowAnonymousAccess. This setting is independent of the configured authentication method and will override anything specified for the authentication provider. zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode NiFi in cluster mode requires a ZooKeeper ensemble for state management and leader election purposes, this operator at the moment does not support single node deployments without ZooKeeper, hence this is a required setting. Configuration happens via a ConfigMap, which needs to contain two keys called ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS with the value being the ZooKeeper connection string and ZOOKEEPER_CHROOT with the value being the ZooKeeper chroot. This ConfigMap typically is created by a ZookeeperZnode of the ZooKeeper Operator. config: sensitivePropertyKeySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key log: rootLogLevel: INFO This is the actual NiFi configuration element. At the moment only a very limited set of options is supported, but you can expect these to grow quickly over time. Anything that is not mentioned here can be configured via configOverrides.

This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. The admin credentials that you can then log in with are: admin:supersecretpassword If you do not provide the admin user credentials the operator can auto generate a random password for you, if you enable this functionality. You can retrieve this password by running the following command: kubectl get secret nifi-admin-credentials-simple -o jsonpath=\"{.data.password}\" | base64 --decode | cat - <(echo) You may need to adjust this command if you change the configuration for adminCredentialsSecret in the example below. apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: NifiCluster metadata: name: simple-nifi spec: version: 1.16.3-stackable0.1.0 zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode config: authentication: method: singleUser: adminCredentialsSecret: nifi-admin-credentials-simple sensitiveProperties: keySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key nodes: roleGroups: default: selector: matchLabels: kubernetes.io/os: linux config: log: rootLogLevel: INFO replicas: 3 If you want to set a password for the initial admin user you can do this by applying the following object: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple stringData: username: admin password: supersecretpassword You can create the ZNode config map referenced in zookeeperConfigMapName via (assuming there is a ZooKeeper cluster called simple-zk: apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: ZookeeperZnode metadata: name: simple-nifi-znode spec: clusterRef: name: simple-zk Every user has to authenticate themselves before using NiFI. There are multiple options to set up the authentication of users. The default setting is to only provision a single user with administrative privileges. You need to specify the username and password of the user. Further users can not be added. NiFI supports authentication of users against an LDAP server. Have a look at the LDAP test and the general Stackable Authentication documentation on how to set it up. In general, it requires you to specify a AuthenticationClass which is used to authenticate the users. Here you have an example usage --- apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: NifiCluster metadata: name: test-nifi spec: config: authentication: method: authenticationClass: ldap-without-tls --- apiVersion: authentication.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: AuthenticationClass metadata: name: ldap-without-tls spec: provider: ldap: hostname: openldap.default.svc.cluster.local searchBase: ou=users,dc=example,dc=org bindCredentials: secretClass: nifi-with-ldap-bind port: 1389 --- apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SecretClass metadata: name: nifi-with-ldap-bind spec: backend: k8sSearch: searchNamespace: pod: {} --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: nifi-with-ldap-bind labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: nifi-with-ldap-bind stringData: user: cn=integrationtest,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org password: integrationtest NiFi supports multiple authorization methods documented here. The available authorization methods depend on the chosen authentication method. Authorization is not fully implemented by the stackable nifi-operator. Because of this the operator currently infers the authorization method to use from the configured authentication method. For this authentication method the Single user authorization will be used. Basically the single user is allowed to do everything. In the future retrieving groups from LDAP and providing policies via OPA is planned. Currently we will use the org.apache.nifi.authorization.FileUserGroupProvider and org.apache.nifi.authorization.FileAccessPolicyProvider. The user specified in the LDAP bind will be the admin user which can log into the NiFi cluster and create and modify other users. He is also able to create and modify groups and polices in the Webinterface. The changes made will be written to local files which are not persistent. The managed NiFi cluster is automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Do not override port numbers. This will lead to cluster malfunction. Apache NiFi runtime configuration is stored in the files bootstrap.conf and nifi.properties. The configOverrides block allows you to add custom parameters to these files. A Full list of the available configuration options can be found in the official Apache NiFi documentation at https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/components/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#system_properties. Overrides consist of a key, which must match the property name in the configuration file and a value. This allows arbitrary configuration properties to be added to Spark. In the example above a property aws.region is being explicitly set to 'eu-west-1', overriding the default value. Please be aware that by overriding config settings in this section you have a very high risk of breaking things, because the product does not behave the way the Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi expects it to behave anymore. The following snippet shows an example of how this would look in the NifiCluster definition: config: sensitivePropertyKeySecret: nifi-sensitive-property- configOverrides: nifi.properties: nifi.config.property: eu-west-1 bootstrap.conf: boostrap.config.property: some_string replicas: 2 Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the envOverrides property. For example per role group: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" or per role: nodes: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 By default, a Nifi cluster will create five different persistent volume claims for flow files, provenance, database, content and state folders. These PVCs will request 2Gi. It is recommended that you configure these volume requests according to your needs. Storage requests can be configured at role or group level, for one or more of the persistent volumes as follows: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: flowfile_repo: capacity: 12Gi provenance_repo: capacity: 12Gi database_repo: capacity: 12Gi content_repo: capacity: 12Gi state_repo: capacity: 12Gi In the above example, all nodes in the default group will request 12Gi of storage the various folders. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each node container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2Gi of memory. Setting this property will automatically also set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"nifi","version":"nightly","name":"usage","url":"/nifi/nightly/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":1},{"text":"Single user","hash":"_single_user","id":2},{"text":"LDAP","hash":"_ldap","id":3},{"text":"Authorization","hash":"_authorization","id":4},{"text":"Single user","hash":"_single_user_2","id":5},{"text":"LDAP","hash":"_ldap_2","id":6},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":7},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":8},{"text":"Configuration Overrides","hash":"_configuration_overrides","id":9},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":10},{"text":"Volume storage","hash":"_volume_storage","id":11},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":12},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":13}]},"295":{"id":295,"text":"After going through the Installation section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a NiFi cluster and the required dependencies.

For this purpose, Stackble provides ready made Docker images with recent versions of Apache Spark and Python - for PySpark jobs - that provide the basis for running those workloads. Users of the Stackable Spark-on-Kubernetes operator can run their workloads on any recent Kubernetes cluster by applying a SparkApplication custom resource in which the job code, job dependencies, input and output data locations can be specified. The Stackable operator translates the user’s SparkApplication manifest into a Kubernetes Job object and handles control to the Apache Spark scheduler for Kubernetes to construct the necessary driver and executor Pods. When the job is finished, the Pods are terminated and the Kubernetes Job is completed. The base images provided by Stackable contain only the minimum of components to run Spark workloads. This is done mostly for performance and compatibility reasons. Many Spark workloads build on top of third party libraries and frameworks and thus depend on additional packages that are not included in the Stackable images. This guide explains how users can provision their Spark jobs with additional dependencies. There are multiple ways to submit Apache Spark jobs with external dependencies. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and the choice of one over the other depends on existing technical and managerial constraints. To provision job dependencies in their workloads, users have to construct their SparkApplication with one of the following dependency specifications: Hardened or encapsulated job images Dependency volumes Spark native package coordinates and Python requirements The following table provides a high level overview of the relevant aspects of each method. Dependency specification Job image size Reproduciblity Dev-op cost Encapsulated job images Large Guaranteed Medium to High Dependency volumes Small Guaranteed Small to Medium Spark and Python packages Small Not guranteed Small With this method, users submit a SparkApplication for which the sparkImage refers to a Docker image containing Apache Spark itself, the job code and dependencies required by the job. It is recommended the users base their image on one of the Stackable images to ensure compatibility with the Stackable operator. Since all packages required to run the Spark job are bundled in the image, the size of this image tends to get very large while at the same time guaranteeing reproducibility between submissions. Example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: spark-pi spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.2.1-hadoop3.2-stackable0.4.0 (1) mode: cluster mainClass: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi mainApplicationFile: /stackable/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.2.1.jar (2) driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" 1 Name of the encapsulated image. 2 Name of the Spark job to run. With this method, the user provisions the job dependencies from a PersistentVolume as shown in this example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-pvc namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.2.1-hadoop3.2-stackable0.4.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny-tlc-report-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (1) mainClass: org.example.App (2) args: - \"'s3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" sparkConf: (3) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/hadoop-aws-3.2.0.jar:/dependencies/jars/aws-java-sdk-bundle-1.11.375.jar\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/hadoop-aws-3.2.0.jar:/dependencies/jars/aws-java-sdk-bundle-1.11.375.jar\" volumes: - name: job-deps (4) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) 1 Job artifact located on S3. 2 Job main class 3 Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3, accessed without credentials) 4 the name of the volume mount backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim that must be pre-existing 5 the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the sparkConf section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors The Spark operator has no control over the contents of the dependency volume. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure all required dependencies are installed in the correct versions. A PersistentVolumeClaim and the associated PersistentVolume can be defined like this: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: pv-ksv (1) spec: storageClassName: standard accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 2Gi hostPath: path: /some-host-location --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-ksv (2) spec: volumeName: pv-ksv (1) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: aws-deps spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: Never volumes: - name: job-deps (3) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv (2) containers: - name: aws-deps volumeMounts: - name: job-deps (4) mountPath: /stackable/spark/dependencies 1 Reference to a PersistentVolume, defining some cluster-reachable storage 2 The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that references the PV 3 Defines a Volume backed by the PVC, local to the Custom Resource 4 Defines the VolumeMount that is used by the Custom Resource The last and most flexible way to provision dependencies is to use the built-in spark-submit support for Maven package coordinates. These can be specified by adding the following section to the SparkApplication manifest file: spec: deps: repositories: - https://repository.example.com/prod packages: - com.example:some-package:1.0.0 excludePackages: - com.example:other-package These directly translate to the spark-submit parameters --packages, --exclude-packages, and --repositories. When submitting PySpark jobs, users can specify pip requirements that are installed before the driver and executor pods are created.

In practice, this is often not the case and spark- and/or job-dependencies will be required. These can be made available in different ways - e.g. by including them in the spark images used by spark-submit, reading them external repositories or by using local external storage such as Kuberentes persistent volumes.

For this purpose, Stackble provides ready made Docker images with recent versions of Apache Spark and Python - for PySpark jobs - that provide the basis for running those workloads. Users of the Stackable Spark-on-Kubernetes operator can run their workloads on any recent Kubernetes cluster by applying a SparkApplication custom resource in which the job code, job dependencies, input and output data locations can be specified. The Stackable operator translates the user’s SparkApplication manifest into a Kubernetes Job object and handles control to the Apache Spark scheduler for Kubernetes to construct the necessary driver and executor Pods. When the job is finished, the Pods are terminated and the Kubernetes Job is completed. The base images provided by Stackable contain only the minimum of components to run Spark workloads. This is done mostly for performance and compatibility reasons. Many Spark workloads build on top of third party libraries and frameworks and thus depend on additional packages that are not included in the Stackable images. This guide explains how users can provision their Spark jobs with additional dependencies. There are multiple ways to submit Apache Spark jobs with external dependencies. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and the choice of one over the other depends on existing technical and managerial constraints. To provision job dependencies in their workloads, users have to construct their SparkApplication with one of the following dependency specifications: Hardened or encapsulated job images Dependency volumes Spark native package coordinates and Python requirements The following table provides a high level overview of the relevant aspects of each method. Dependency specification Job image size Reproduciblity Dev-op cost Encapsulated job images Large Guaranteed Medium to High Dependency volumes Small Guaranteed Small to Medium Spark and Python packages Small Not guranteed Small With this method, users submit a SparkApplication for which the sparkImage refers to a Docker image containing Apache Spark itself, the job code and dependencies required by the job. It is recommended the users base their image on one of the Stackable images to ensure compatibility with the Stackable operator. Since all packages required to run the Spark job are bundled in the image, the size of this image tends to get very large while at the same time guaranteeing reproducibility between submissions. Example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: spark-pi spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 (1) mode: cluster mainClass: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi mainApplicationFile: /stackable/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.3.0.jar (2) driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" 1 Name of the encapsulated image. 2 Name of the Spark job to run. With this method, the user provisions the job dependencies from a PersistentVolume as shown in this example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-pvc namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny-tlc-report-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (1) mainClass: org.example.App (2) args: - \"'s3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" sparkConf: (3) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" volumes: - name: job-deps (4) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) 1 Job artifact located on S3. 2 Job main class 3 Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3, accessed without credentials) 4 the name of the volume mount backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim that must be pre-existing 5 the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the sparkConf section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors The Spark operator has no control over the contents of the dependency volume. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure all required dependencies are installed in the correct versions. A PersistentVolumeClaim and the associated PersistentVolume can be defined like this: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: pv-ksv (1) spec: storageClassName: standard accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 2Gi hostPath: path: /some-host-location --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-ksv (2) spec: volumeName: pv-ksv (1) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: aws-deps spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: Never volumes: - name: job-deps (3) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv (2) containers: - name: aws-deps volumeMounts: - name: job-deps (4) mountPath: /stackable/spark/dependencies 1 Reference to a PersistentVolume, defining some cluster-reachable storage 2 The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that references the PV 3 Defines a Volume backed by the PVC, local to the Custom Resource 4 Defines the VolumeMount that is used by the Custom Resource The last and most flexible way to provision dependencies is to use the built-in spark-submit support for Maven package coordinates. These can be specified by adding the following section to the SparkApplication manifest file: spec: deps: repositories: - https://repository.example.com/prod packages: - com.example:some-package:1.0.0 excludePackages: - com.example:other-package These directly translate to the spark-submit parameters --packages, --exclude-packages, and --repositories. When submitting PySpark jobs, users can specify pip requirements that are installed before the driver and executor pods are created. Here is an example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-external-dependencies namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/pyspark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny_tlc_report.py (1) args: - \"--input 's3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" (2) deps: requirements: - tabulate==0.8.9 (3) sparkConf: (4) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" volumes: - name: job-deps (5) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (6) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (6) Note the section requirements.

In practice, this is often not the case and spark- and/or job-dependencies will be required. These can be made available in different ways - e.g. by including them in the spark images used by spark-submit, reading them external repositories or by using local external storage such as Kuberentes persistent volumes.

For this purpose, Stackble provides ready made Docker images with recent versions of Apache Spark and Python - for PySpark jobs - that provide the basis for running those workloads. Users of the Stackable Spark-on-Kubernetes operator can run their workloads on any recent Kubernetes cluster by applying a SparkApplication custom resource in which the job code, job dependencies, input and output data locations can be specified. The Stackable operator translates the user’s SparkApplication manifest into a Kubernetes Job object and handles control to the Apache Spark scheduler for Kubernetes to construct the necessary driver and executor Pods. When the job is finished, the Pods are terminated and the Kubernetes Job is completed. The base images provided by Stackable contain only the minimum of components to run Spark workloads. This is done mostly for performance and compatibility reasons. Many Spark workloads build on top of third party libraries and frameworks and thus depend on additional packages that are not included in the Stackable images. This guide explains how users can provision their Spark jobs with additional dependencies. There are multiple ways to submit Apache Spark jobs with external dependencies. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and the choice of one over the other depends on existing technical and managerial constraints. To provision job dependencies in their workloads, users have to construct their SparkApplication with one of the following dependency specifications: Hardened or encapsulated job images Dependency volumes Spark native package coordinates and Python requirements The following table provides a high level overview of the relevant aspects of each method. Dependency specification Job image size Reproduciblity Dev-op cost Encapsulated job images Large Guaranteed Medium to High Dependency volumes Small Guaranteed Small to Medium Spark and Python packages Small Not guranteed Small With this method, users submit a SparkApplication for which the sparkImage refers to a Docker image containing Apache Spark itself, the job code and dependencies required by the job. It is recommended the users base their image on one of the Stackable images to ensure compatibility with the Stackable operator. Since all packages required to run the Spark job are bundled in the image, the size of this image tends to get very large while at the same time guaranteeing reproducibility between submissions. Example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: spark-pi spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 (1) mode: cluster mainClass: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi mainApplicationFile: /stackable/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.3.0.jar (2) driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" 1 Name of the encapsulated image. 2 Name of the Spark job to run. With this method, the user provisions the job dependencies from a PersistentVolume as shown in this example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-pvc namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny-tlc-report-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (1) mainClass: org.example.App (2) args: - \"'s3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" sparkConf: (3) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" volumes: - name: job-deps (4) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) 1 Job artifact located on S3. 2 Job main class 3 Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3, accessed without credentials) 4 the name of the volume mount backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim that must be pre-existing 5 the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the sparkConf section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors The Spark operator has no control over the contents of the dependency volume. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure all required dependencies are installed in the correct versions. A PersistentVolumeClaim and the associated PersistentVolume can be defined like this: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: pv-ksv (1) spec: storageClassName: standard accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 2Gi hostPath: path: /some-host-location --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-ksv (2) spec: volumeName: pv-ksv (1) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: aws-deps spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: Never volumes: - name: job-deps (3) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv (2) containers: - name: aws-deps volumeMounts: - name: job-deps (4) mountPath: /stackable/spark/dependencies 1 Reference to a PersistentVolume, defining some cluster-reachable storage 2 The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that references the PV 3 Defines a Volume backed by the PVC, local to the Custom Resource 4 Defines the VolumeMount that is used by the Custom Resource The last and most flexible way to provision dependencies is to use the built-in spark-submit support for Maven package coordinates. These can be specified by adding the following section to the SparkApplication manifest file: spec: deps: repositories: - https://repository.example.com/prod packages: - com.example:some-package:1.0.0 excludePackages: - com.example:other-package These directly translate to the spark-submit parameters --packages, --exclude-packages, and --repositories. When submitting PySpark jobs, users can specify pip requirements that are installed before the driver and executor pods are created. Here is an example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-external-dependencies namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/pyspark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny_tlc_report.py (1) args: - \"--input 's3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" (2) deps: requirements: - tabulate==0.8.9 (3) sparkConf: (4) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" volumes: - name: job-deps (5) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (6) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (6) Note the section requirements.

For this purpose, Stackble provides ready made Docker images with recent versions of Apache Spark and Python - for PySpark jobs - that provide the basis for running those workloads. Users of the Stackable Spark-on-Kubernetes operator can run their workloads on any recent Kubernetes cluster by applying a SparkApplication custom resource in which the job code, job dependencies, input and output data locations can be specified. The Stackable operator translates the user’s SparkApplication manifest into a Kubernetes Job object and handles control to the Apache Spark scheduler for Kubernetes to construct the necessary driver and executor Pods. When the job is finished, the Pods are terminated and the Kubernetes Job is completed. The base images provided by Stackable contain only the minimum of components to run Spark workloads. This is done mostly for performance and compatibility reasons. Many Spark workloads build on top of third party libraries and frameworks and thus depend on additional packages that are not included in the Stackable images. This guide explains how users can provision their Spark jobs with additional dependencies. There are multiple ways to submit Apache Spark jobs with external dependencies. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and the choice of one over the other depends on existing technical and managerial constraints. To provision job dependencies in their workloads, users have to construct their SparkApplication with one of the following dependency specifications: Hardened or encapsulated job images Dependency volumes Spark native package coordinates and Python requirements The following table provides a high level overview of the relevant aspects of each method. Dependency specification Job image size Reproduciblity Dev-op cost Encapsulated job images Large Guaranteed Medium to High Dependency volumes Small Guaranteed Small to Medium Spark and Python packages Small Not guranteed Small With this method, users submit a SparkApplication for which the sparkImage refers to a Docker image containing Apache Spark itself, the job code and dependencies required by the job. It is recommended the users base their image on one of the Stackable images to ensure compatibility with the Stackable operator. Since all packages required to run the Spark job are bundled in the image, the size of this image tends to get very large while at the same time guaranteeing reproducibility between submissions. Example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: spark-pi spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 (1) mode: cluster mainClass: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi mainApplicationFile: /stackable/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.3.0.jar (2) driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" 1 Name of the encapsulated image. 2 Name of the Spark job to run. With this method, the user provisions the job dependencies from a PersistentVolume as shown in this example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-pvc namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny-tlc-report-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (1) mainClass: org.example.App (2) args: - \"'s3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" sparkConf: (3) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" volumes: - name: job-deps (4) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (5) 1 Job artifact located on S3. 2 Job main class 3 Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3, accessed without credentials) 4 the name of the volume mount backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim that must be pre-existing 5 the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the sparkConf section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors The Spark operator has no control over the contents of the dependency volume. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure all required dependencies are installed in the correct versions. A PersistentVolumeClaim and the associated PersistentVolume can be defined like this: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: pv-ksv (1) spec: storageClassName: standard accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 2Gi hostPath: path: /some-host-location --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-ksv (2) spec: volumeName: pv-ksv (1) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: aws-deps spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: Never volumes: - name: job-deps (3) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv (2) containers: - name: aws-deps volumeMounts: - name: job-deps (4) mountPath: /stackable/spark/dependencies 1 Reference to a PersistentVolume, defining some cluster-reachable storage 2 The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that references the PV 3 Defines a Volume backed by the PVC, local to the Custom Resource 4 Defines the VolumeMount that is used by the Custom Resource The last and most flexible way to provision dependencies is to use the built-in spark-submit support for Maven package coordinates. These can be specified by adding the following section to the SparkApplication manifest file: spec: deps: repositories: - https://repository.example.com/prod packages: - com.example:some-package:1.0.0 excludePackages: - com.example:other-package These directly translate to the spark-submit parameters --packages, --exclude-packages, and --repositories. When submitting PySpark jobs, users can specify pip requirements that are installed before the driver and executor pods are created. Here is an example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: example-sparkapp-external-dependencies namespace: default spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/pyspark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 mode: cluster mainApplicationFile: s3a://stackable-spark-k8s-jars/jobs/ny_tlc_report.py (1) args: - \"--input 's3a://nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2021-07.csv'\" (2) deps: requirements: - tabulate==0.8.9 (3) sparkConf: (4) \"spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider\" \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\": \"/dependencies/jars/*\" volumes: - name: job-deps (5) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (6) executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" volumeMounts: - name: job-deps mountPath: /dependencies (6) Note the section requirements.

For this purpose, Stackble provides ready made Docker images with recent versions of Apache Spark and Python - for PySpark jobs - that provide the basis for running those workloads. Users of the Stackable Spark-on-Kubernetes operator can run their workloads on any recent Kubernetes cluster by applying a SparkApplication custom resource in which the job code, job dependencies, input and output data locations can be specified. The Stackable operator translates the user’s SparkApplication manifest into a Kubernetes Job object and handles control to the Apache Spark scheduler for Kubernetes to construct the necessary driver and executor Pods. When the job is finished, the Pods are terminated and the Kubernetes Job is completed. The base images provided by Stackable contain only the minimum of components to run Spark workloads. This is done mostly for performance and compatibility reasons. Many Spark workloads build on top of third party libraries and frameworks and thus depend on additional packages that are not included in the Stackable images. This guide explains how users can provision their Spark jobs with additional dependencies. There are multiple ways to submit Apache Spark jobs with external dependencies. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and the choice of one over the other depends on existing technical and managerial constraints. To provision job dependencies in their workloads, users have to construct their SparkApplication with one of the following dependency specifications: Hardened or encapsulated job images Dependency volumes Spark native package coordinates and Python requirements The following table provides a high level overview of the relevant aspects of each method. Dependency specification Job image size Reproduciblity Dev-op cost Encapsulated job images Large Guaranteed Medium to High Dependency volumes Small Guaranteed Small to Medium Spark and Python packages Small Not guranteed Small With this method, users submit a SparkApplication for which the sparkImage refers to a Docker image containing Apache Spark itself, the job code and dependencies required by the job. It is recommended the users base their image on one of the Stackable images to ensure compatibility with the Stackable operator. Since all packages required to run the Spark job are bundled in the image, the size of this image tends to get very large while at the same time guaranteeing reproducibility between submissions. Example: --- apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SparkApplication metadata: name: spark-pi spec: version: \"1.0\" sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0 (1) mode: cluster mainClass: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi mainApplicationFile: /stackable/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.3.0.jar (2) driver: cores: 1 coreLimit: \"1200m\" memory: \"512m\" executor: cores: 1 instances: 3 memory: \"512m\" 1 Name of the encapsulated image. 2 Name of the Spark job to run.

It is the responsibility of the user to make sure all required dependencies are installed in the correct versions. A PersistentVolumeClaim and the associated PersistentVolume can be defined like this: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: pv-ksv (1) spec: storageClassName: standard accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 2Gi hostPath: path: /some-host-location --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-ksv (2) spec: volumeName: pv-ksv (1) accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: aws-deps spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: Never volumes: - name: job-deps (3) persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-ksv (2) containers: - name: aws-deps volumeMounts: - name: job-deps (4) mountPath: /stackable/spark/dependencies 1 Reference to a PersistentVolume, defining some cluster-reachable storage 2 The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim that references the PV 3 Defines a Volume backed by the PVC, local to the Custom Resource 4 Defines the VolumeMount that is used by the Custom Resource The last and most flexible way to provision dependencies is to use the built-in spark-submit support for Maven package coordinates. These can be specified by adding the following section to the SparkApplication manifest file: spec: deps: repositories: - https://repository.example.com/prod packages: - com.example:some-package:1.0.0 excludePackages: - com.example:other-package These directly translate to the spark-submit parameters --packages, --exclude-packages, and --repositories. When submitting PySpark jobs, users can specify pip requirements that are installed before the driver and executor pods are created.

Spark applications almost always require dependencies like database drivers, REST api clients and many others. These dependencies must be available on the classpath of each executor (and in some cases of the driver, too). There are multiple ways to provision Spark jobs with such dependencies: some are built into Spark itself while others are implemented at the operator level. In this guide we are going to keep things simple and look at executing a Spark job that has a minimum of dependencies. More information about the different ways to define Spark jobs and their dependencies is given on the following pages: Usage Job Dependencies There are 2 ways to install Stackable operators Using stackablectl Using a Helm chart stackablectl is the command line tool to interact with Stackable operators and our recommended way to install Operators. Follow the installation steps for your platform. After you have installed stackablectl run the following command to install the Spark-k8s operator: stackablectl operator install \\ commons=0.3.0-nightly \\ secret=0.6.0-nightly \\ spark-k8s=0.5.0-nightly The tool will show [INFO ] Installing commons operator [INFO ] Installing secret operator [INFO ] Installing spark-k8s operator Consult the Quickstart to learn more about how to use stackablectl. For example, you can use the -k flag to create a Kubernetes cluster with kind. You can also use Helm to install the operator.

The rowLimit configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data. The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a SupersetDB resource with the same name as the cluster. It ensures that the database is initialized (schema created, admin user created). A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while. When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the browser. The Superset port which defaults to 8088 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward service/simple-superset-external 8088 Then it can be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8088. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret: If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available: Every user has to authenticate themselves before using Superset.

Superset supports authentication of users against an LDAP server. Have a look at the LDAP example and the general Stackable Authentication documentation on how to set it up. In general, it requires you to specify a AuthenticationClass which is used to authenticate the users. In this example we assign all the users the Admin role once they log into Superset. apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SupersetCluster metadata: name: superset-with-ldap-server-veri-tls spec: version: 1.5.1-stackable0.1.0 [...] authenticationConfig: authenticationClass: superset-with-ldap-server-veri-tls-ldap userRegistrationRole: Admin Superset has a concept called Roles which allows you to grant user permissions based on roles. Have a look at the Superset documentation on Security. You can see all the available roles in the Webinterface of Superset. You can view all the available roles in the Webinterface of Superset and can also assign users to these roles. Superset supports assigning roles to users based on their LDAP group membership. This is not supported yet. Currently all the users logging in via LDAP get assigned the same role which you can configure via the attribute authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole on the SupersetCluster object. The operator can automatically connect Superset to Apache Druid clusters managed by the Stackable Druid Cluster. To do so, create a DruidConnection resource: apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: DruidConnection metadata: name: superset-druid-connection spec: superset: name: superset namespace: default druid: name: my-druid-cluster namespace: default The name and namespace in spec.superset refer to the Superset cluster that you want to connect. Following our example above, the name is superset. In spec.druid you specify the name and namespace of your Druid cluster. The namespace part is optional; if it is omitted it will default to the namespace of the DruidConnection. The namespace for the Superset and Druid cluster can be omitted, in that case the Operator will assume that they are in the same namespace as the DruidConnection. Once the database is initialized, the connection will be added to the cluster by the operator. You can see it in the user interface under Data > Databases: The managed Superset instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by the operator (such as the STATS_LOGGER) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify configOverrides for the superset_config.py. For example, if you want to set the CSV export encoding and the preferred databases adapt the nodes section of the cluster resource like so: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} configOverrides: superset_config.py: CSV_EXPORT: \"{'encoding': 'utf-8'}\" PREFERRED_DATABASES: |- [ 'PostgreSQL', 'Presto', 'MySQL', 'SQLite', # etc. ] Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at the role level as well: nodes: configOverrides: superset_config.py: CSV_EXPORT: \"{'encoding': 'utf-8'}\" PREFERRED_DATABASES: |- [ 'PostgreSQL', 'Presto', 'MySQL', 'SQLite', # etc. ] roleGroups: default: config: {} All override property values must be strings. They are treated as Python expressions. So care must be taken to not produce an invalid configuration. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the main config file for Superset. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: nodes: roleGroups: default: config: {} envOverrides: FLASK_ENV: development or per role: nodes: envOverrides: FLASK_ENV: development roleGroups: default: config:

Superset metadata (slices, connections, tables, dashboards etc.) is stored in an SQL database. For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following commands: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install --wait superset bitnami/postgresql \\ --set auth.username=superset \\ --set auth.password=superset \\ --set auth.database=superset A secret with the necessary credentials must be created: this contains database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Superset itself. Create a file called superset-credentials.yaml: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: simple-superset-credentials type: Opaque stringData: adminUser.username: admin adminUser.firstname: Superset adminUser.lastname: Admin adminUser.email: admin@superset.com adminUser.password: admin connections.secretKey: thisISaSECRET_1234 connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri: postgresql://superset:superset@superset-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/superset And apply it: kubectl apply -f superset-credentials.yaml The connections.secretKey will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes. connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Superset metadata. The adminUser fields are used to create an admin user. Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP. A Superset node must be created as a custom resource, create file called superset.yaml: --- apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SupersetCluster metadata: name: simple-superset spec: version: 1.5.1-stackable0.1.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 credentialsSecret: simple-superset-credentials loadExamplesOnInit: true nodes: roleGroups: default: config: rowLimit: 10000 webserverTimeout: 300 And apply it: kubectl apply -f superset.yaml metadata.name contains the name of the Superset cluster. The label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in spec.version. Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of Apache Superset which you want to roll out, but has to also include the Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. spec.statsdExporterVersion must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository. The previously created secret must be referenced in spec.credentialsSecret. The spec.loadExamplesOnInit key is optional and defaults to false, it can be set to true to load example data into Superset when the database is initialized. The rowLimit configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data. The webserverTimeout configuration option defines the maximum number of seconds a Superset request can take before timing out. This settings effect the maximum duration a query to an underlying datasource can take. If you get timeout errors before your query returns the result you may need to increase this timeout. The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a SupersetDB resource with the same name as the cluster. It ensures that the database is initialized (with the creation of a schema and admin user). A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while. You can use kubectl to wait on the resource: kubectl wait supersetdb/simple-superset \\ --for jsonpath='{.status.condition}'=Ready \\ --timeout 300s When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the browser. The Superset port which defaults to 8088 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward service/simple-superset-external 8088 2>&1 >/dev/null & Then it can be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8088.

Superset metadata (slices, connections, tables, dashboards etc.) is stored in an SQL database. For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following commands: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install --wait superset bitnami/postgresql \\ --set auth.username=superset \\ --set auth.password=superset \\ --set auth.database=superset A secret with the necessary credentials must be created: this contains database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Superset itself. Create a file called superset-credentials.yaml: --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: simple-superset-credentials type: Opaque stringData: adminUser.username: admin adminUser.firstname: Superset adminUser.lastname: Admin adminUser.email: admin@superset.com adminUser.password: admin connections.secretKey: thisISaSECRET_1234 connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri: postgresql://superset:superset@superset-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/superset And apply it: kubectl apply -f superset-credentials.yaml The connections.secretKey will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes. connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Superset metadata. The adminUser fields are used to create an admin user. Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP. A Superset node must be created as a custom resource, create file called superset.yaml: --- apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SupersetCluster metadata: name: simple-superset spec: version: 1.5.1-stackable0.1.0 statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4 credentialsSecret: simple-superset-credentials loadExamplesOnInit: true nodes: roleGroups: default: config: rowLimit: 10000 webserverTimeout: 300 And apply it: kubectl apply -f superset.yaml metadata.name contains the name of the Superset cluster. The label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in spec.version. Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of Apache Superset which you want to roll out, but has to also include the Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our image registry. It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available. spec.statsdExporterVersion must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository. The previously created secret must be referenced in spec.credentialsSecret. The spec.loadExamplesOnInit key is optional and defaults to false, it can be set to true to load example data into Superset when the database is initialized. The rowLimit configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data. The webserverTimeout configuration option defines the maximum number of seconds a Superset request can take before timing out. This settings effect the maximum duration a query to an underlying datasource can take. If you get timeout errors before your query returns the result you may need to increase this timeout. The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a SupersetDB resource with the same name as the cluster. It ensures that the database is initialized (with the creation of a schema and admin user). A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while. You can use kubectl to wait on the resource: kubectl wait supersetdb/simple-superset \\ --for jsonpath='{.status.condition}'=Ready \\ --timeout 300s When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the browser. The Superset port which defaults to 8088 can be forwarded to the local host: kubectl port-forward service/simple-superset-external 8088 2>&1 >/dev/null & Then it can be opened in the browser with http://localhost:8088.

You can mount a volume where data (config and logs of Trino) is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role or role group: workers: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 3Gi In the above example, all Trino workers in the default group will store data (the location of the property --data-dir) on a 3Gi volume. Additional role groups not specifying any resources will inherit the config provided on the role level (2Gi volume). This works the same for memory or CPU requests. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 2Gi large local volume mount for the data location containing mainly logs. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each Trino container in the default group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the container running Trino but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' If nothing is specified, the operator will automatically set the following default values for resources: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 2Gi limits: cpu: \"4\" memory: 2Gi storage: data: capacity: 2Gi The default values are most likely not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements.

If authentication is enabled, TLS for the coordinator as well as a shared secret for internal communications (this is base64 and not encrypted) must be configured. Securing the Trino cluster will disable all HTTP ports and disable the web interface on the HTTP port as well. apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: TrinoCluster metadata: name: simple-trino spec: version: 387-stackable0.1.0 config: tls: secretClass: trino-tls authentication: method: multiUser: userCredentialsSecret: name: simple-trino-users-secret [..] If no config.tls.secretClass is provided but authentication is enabled, it will default to tls provided by the Secret Operator. ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server https://: --user=admin --keystore-path=keystore.p12 --keystore-password=changeit or ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server https://: --user=admin --insecure This will disable the HTTP port and UI access and encrypt client-server communications. apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: TrinoCluster metadata: name: simple-trino spec: version: 387-stackable0.1.0 config: tls: secretClass: trino-tls [..] ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server https://: --user=admin --keystore-path=keystore.p12 --keystore-password=changeit Internal TLS is for encrypted and authenticated communications between coordinators and workers. Since this applies to all the data send and processed between the processes, this may reduce the performance significantly. apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: TrinoCluster metadata: name: simple-trino spec: version: 387-stackable0.1.0 config: internalTls: secretClass: trino-internal-tls [..] Since Trino has internal and external communications running over a single port, this will enable the HTTPS port but not expose it. Cluster access is only possible via HTTP. ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server http://: --user=admin You can specify S3 connection details directly inside the TrinoCatalog specification or by referring to an external S3Connection custom resource. To specify S3 connection details directly as part of the TrinoCatalog resource, you add an inline connection configuration as shown below: s3: (1) inline: host: test-minio (2) port: 9000 (3) pathStyleAccess: true (4) secretClass: minio-credentials (5) tls: verification: server: caCert: secretClass: minio-tls-certificates (6) 1 Entry point for the connection configuration 2 Connection host 3 Optional connection port 4 Optional flag if path-style URLs should be used; This defaults to false which means virtual hosted-style URLs are used. 5 Name of the Secret object expected to contain the following keys: accessKey and secretKey 6 Optional TLS settings for encrypted traffic. The secretClass can be provided by the Secret Operator or yourself. A self provided S3 TLS secret can be specified like this: apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SecretClass metadata: name: minio-tls-certificates spec: backend: k8sSearch: searchNamespace: pod: {} --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: minio-tls-certificates labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: minio-tls-certificates data: ca.crt: tls.crt: tls.key: It is also possible to configure the bucket connection details as a separate Kubernetes resource and only refer to that object from the TrinoCatalog specification like this: s3: reference: my-connection-resource (1) 1 Name of the connection resource with connection details The resource named my-connection-resource is then defined as shown below: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Connection metadata: name: my-connection-resource spec: host: test-minio port: 9000 accessStyle: Path credentials: secretClass: minio-credentials This has the advantage that the connection configuration can be shared across applications and reduces the cost of updating these details. Create a schema and a table for the Iris data located in S3 and query data. This assumes to have the Iris data set in the PARQUET format available in the S3 bucket which can be downloaded here CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS hive.iris WITH (location = 's3a://iris/'); which should return: CREATE SCHEMA CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hive.iris.iris_parquet ( sepal_length DOUBLE, sepal_width DOUBLE, petal_length DOUBLE, petal_width DOUBLE, class VARCHAR ) WITH ( external_location = 's3a://iris/parq', format = 'PARQUET' ); which should return: CREATE TABLE SELECT sepal_length, class FROM hive.iris.iris_parquet LIMIT 10; which should return something like this: sepal_length | class --------------+------------- 5.1 | Iris-setosa 4.9 | Iris-setosa 4.7 | Iris-setosa 4.6 | Iris-setosa 5.0 | Iris-setosa 5.4 | Iris-setosa 4.6 | Iris-setosa 5.0 | Iris-setosa 4.4 | Iris-setosa 4.9 | Iris-setosa (10 rows) Query 20220210_161615_00000_a8nka, FINISHED, 1 node https://172.18.0.5:30299/ui/query.html?20220210_161615_00000_a8nka Splits: 18 total, 18 done (100.00%) CPU Time: 0.7s total, 20 rows/s, 11.3KB/s, 74% active Per Node: 0.3 parallelism, 5 rows/s, 3.02KB/s Parallelism: 0.3 Peak Memory: 0B 2.67 [15 rows, 8.08KB] [5 rows/s, 3.02KB/s] The managed Trino instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Do not override port numbers. This will lead to faulty installations. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for: config.properties node.properties log.properties password-authenticator.properties For a list of possible configuration properties consult the Trino Properties Reference. workers: roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 configOverrides: config.properties: query.max-memory-per-node: \"2GB\" Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: workers: configOverrides: config.properties: query.max-memory-per-node: \"2GB\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. The properties will be passed on without any escaping or formatting. Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the envOverrides property. For example per role group: workers: roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 envOverrides: JAVA_HOME: \"path/to/java\" or per role: workers: envOverrides: JAVA_HOME: \"path/to/java\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 Here too, overriding properties such as http-server.https.port will lead to broken installations. You can mount a volume where data (config and logs of Trino) is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role or role group: workers: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 3Gi In the above example, all Trino workers in the default group will store data (the location of the property --data-dir) on a 3Gi volume. Additional role groups not specifying any resources will inherit the config provided on the role level (2Gi volume). This works the same for memory or CPU requests. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 2Gi large local volume mount for the data location containing mainly logs. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each Trino container in the default group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the container running Trino but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' If nothing is specified, the operator will automatically set the following default values for resources: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 2Gi limits: cpu: \"4\" memory: 2Gi storage: data: capacity: 2Gi The default values are most likely not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements. For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"trino","version":"0.6","name":"usage","url":"/trino/stable/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":2},{"text":"S3 bucket","hash":"_s3_bucket","id":3},{"text":"Hive operator","hash":"_hive_operator","id":4},{"text":"OPA operator","hash":"_opa_operator","id":5},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":6},{"text":"Authorization","hash":"_authorization","id":7},{"text":"Trino","hash":"_trino","id":8},{"text":"Insecure for testing:","hash":"_insecure_for_testing","id":9},{"text":"Secure for production:","hash":"_secure_for_production","id":10},{"text":"Via authentication","hash":"_via_authentication","id":11},{"text":"Via TLS only","hash":"_via_tls_only","id":12},{"text":"Via internal TLS","hash":"_via_internal_tls","id":13},{"text":"S3 connection specification","hash":"_s3_connection_specification","id":14},{"text":"Test Trino with Hive and S3","hash":"_test_trino_with_hive_and_s3","id":15},{"text":"Create schema","hash":"_create_schema","id":16},{"text":"Create table","hash":"_create_table","id":17},{"text":"Query data","hash":"_query_data","id":18},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":19},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":20},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":21},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":22},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":23},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":24},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":25},{"text":"Defaults","hash":"_defaults","id":26}]},"417":{"id":417,"text":"After going through the Installation section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a Trino cluster and the required dependencies.

If authentication is enabled, TLS for the coordinator as well as a shared secret for internal communications (this is base64 and not encrypted) must be configured. Securing the Trino cluster will disable all HTTP ports and disable the web interface on the HTTP port as well. apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: TrinoCluster metadata: name: simple-trino spec: version: 387-stackable0.1.0 config: tls: secretClass: trino-tls authentication: method: multiUser: userCredentialsSecret: name: simple-trino-users-secret [..] If no config.tls.secretClass is provided but authentication is enabled, it will default to tls provided by the Secret Operator. ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server https://: --user=admin --keystore-path=keystore.p12 --keystore-password=changeit or ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server https://: --user=admin --insecure This will disable the HTTP port and UI access and encrypt client-server communications. apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: TrinoCluster metadata: name: simple-trino spec: version: 387-stackable0.1.0 config: tls: secretClass: trino-tls [..] ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server https://: --user=admin --keystore-path=keystore.p12 --keystore-password=changeit Internal TLS is for encrypted and authenticated communications between coordinators and workers. Since this applies to all the data send and processed between the processes, this may reduce the performance significantly. apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: TrinoCluster metadata: name: simple-trino spec: version: 387-stackable0.1.0 config: internalTls: secretClass: trino-internal-tls [..] Since Trino has internal and external communications running over a single port, this will enable the HTTPS port but not expose it. Cluster access is only possible via HTTP. ./trino-cli-387-executable.jar --debug --server http://: --user=admin You can specify S3 connection details directly inside the TrinoCatalog specification or by referring to an external S3Connection custom resource. To specify S3 connection details directly as part of the TrinoCatalog resource, you add an inline connection configuration as shown below: s3: (1) inline: host: test-minio (2) port: 9000 (3) pathStyleAccess: true (4) secretClass: minio-credentials (5) tls: verification: server: caCert: secretClass: minio-tls-certificates (6) 1 Entry point for the connection configuration 2 Connection host 3 Optional connection port 4 Optional flag if path-style URLs should be used; This defaults to false which means virtual hosted-style URLs are used. 5 Name of the Secret object expected to contain the following keys: accessKey and secretKey 6 Optional TLS settings for encrypted traffic. The secretClass can be provided by the Secret Operator or yourself. A self provided S3 TLS secret can be specified like this: apiVersion: secrets.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: SecretClass metadata: name: minio-tls-certificates spec: backend: k8sSearch: searchNamespace: pod: {} --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: minio-tls-certificates labels: secrets.stackable.tech/class: minio-tls-certificates data: ca.crt: tls.crt: tls.key: It is also possible to configure the bucket connection details as a separate Kubernetes resource and only refer to that object from the TrinoCatalog specification like this: s3: reference: my-connection-resource (1) 1 Name of the connection resource with connection details The resource named my-connection-resource is then defined as shown below: --- apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1 kind: S3Connection metadata: name: my-connection-resource spec: host: test-minio port: 9000 accessStyle: Path credentials: secretClass: minio-credentials This has the advantage that the connection configuration can be shared across applications and reduces the cost of updating these details. Create a schema and a table for the Iris data located in S3 and query data. This assumes to have the Iris data set in the PARQUET format available in the S3 bucket which can be downloaded here CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS hive.iris WITH (location = 's3a://iris/'); which should return: CREATE SCHEMA CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hive.iris.iris_parquet ( sepal_length DOUBLE, sepal_width DOUBLE, petal_length DOUBLE, petal_width DOUBLE, class VARCHAR ) WITH ( external_location = 's3a://iris/parq', format = 'PARQUET' ); which should return: CREATE TABLE SELECT sepal_length, class FROM hive.iris.iris_parquet LIMIT 10; which should return something like this: sepal_length | class --------------+------------- 5.1 | Iris-setosa 4.9 | Iris-setosa 4.7 | Iris-setosa 4.6 | Iris-setosa 5.0 | Iris-setosa 5.4 | Iris-setosa 4.6 | Iris-setosa 5.0 | Iris-setosa 4.4 | Iris-setosa 4.9 | Iris-setosa (10 rows) Query 20220210_161615_00000_a8nka, FINISHED, 1 node https://172.18.0.5:30299/ui/query.html?20220210_161615_00000_a8nka Splits: 18 total, 18 done (100.00%) CPU Time: 0.7s total, 20 rows/s, 11.3KB/s, 74% active Per Node: 0.3 parallelism, 5 rows/s, 3.02KB/s Parallelism: 0.3 Peak Memory: 0B 2.67 [15 rows, 8.08KB] [5 rows/s, 3.02KB/s] The managed Trino instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Do not override port numbers. This will lead to faulty installations. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for: config.properties node.properties log.properties password-authenticator.properties For a list of possible configuration properties consult the Trino Properties Reference. workers: roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 configOverrides: config.properties: query.max-memory-per-node: \"2GB\" Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: workers: configOverrides: config.properties: query.max-memory-per-node: \"2GB\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. The properties will be passed on without any escaping or formatting. Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the envOverrides property. For example per role group: workers: roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 envOverrides: JAVA_HOME: \"path/to/java\" or per role: workers: envOverrides: JAVA_HOME: \"path/to/java\" roleGroups: default: config: {} replicas: 1 Here too, overriding properties such as http-server.https.port will lead to broken installations. You can mount a volume where data (config and logs of Trino) is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role or role group: workers: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 3Gi In the above example, all Trino workers in the default group will store data (the location of the property --data-dir) on a 3Gi volume. Additional role groups not specifying any resources will inherit the config provided on the role level (2Gi volume). This works the same for memory or CPU requests. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 2Gi large local volume mount for the data location containing mainly logs. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each Trino container in the default group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the container running Trino but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' If nothing is specified, the operator will automatically set the following default values for resources: workers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 2Gi limits: cpu: \"4\" memory: 2Gi storage: data: capacity: 2Gi The default values are most likely not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements. For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"trino","version":"nightly","name":"usage","url":"/trino/nightly/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":2},{"text":"S3 bucket","hash":"_s3_bucket","id":3},{"text":"Hive operator","hash":"_hive_operator","id":4},{"text":"OPA operator","hash":"_opa_operator","id":5},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":6},{"text":"Authorization","hash":"_authorization","id":7},{"text":"Trino","hash":"_trino","id":8},{"text":"Insecure for testing:","hash":"_insecure_for_testing","id":9},{"text":"Secure for production:","hash":"_secure_for_production","id":10},{"text":"Via authentication","hash":"_via_authentication","id":11},{"text":"Via TLS only","hash":"_via_tls_only","id":12},{"text":"Via internal TLS","hash":"_via_internal_tls","id":13},{"text":"S3 connection specification","hash":"_s3_connection_specification","id":14},{"text":"Test Trino with Hive and S3","hash":"_test_trino_with_hive_and_s3","id":15},{"text":"Create schema","hash":"_create_schema","id":16},{"text":"Create table","hash":"_create_table","id":17},{"text":"Query data","hash":"_query_data","id":18},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":19},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":20},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":21},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":22},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":23},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":24},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":25},{"text":"Defaults","hash":"_defaults","id":26}]},"425":{"id":425,"text":"After going through the Installation section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a Trino cluster and the required dependencies.

Due to a bug in ZooKeeper, the clientPort property in combination with client.portUnification=true is used instead of the secureClientPort. This means that unencrypted and unauthenticated access to the ZooKeeper cluster is still possible. The managed ZooKeeper instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the ports) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the zoo.cfg. For example, if you want to set the 4lw.commands.whitelist to allow the ruok administrative command, it can be configured in the ZookeeperCluster resource like so: servers: roleGroups: default: configOverrides: zoo.cfg: 4lw.commands.whitelist: \"srvr, ruok\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: routers: configOverrides: zoo.cfg: 4lw.commands.whitelist: \"srvr, ruok\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache ZooKeeper Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: servers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: servers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: servers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi In the above example, all ZooKeeper nodes in the default group will store data (the location of the property dataDir) on a 2Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: servers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each ZooKeeper container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the ZooKeeper daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit.

This is optional. 2 The referenced AuthenticationClass that references a SecretClass to provide certificates. 3 The reference to a SecretClass. 4 The SecretClass that is referenced by the AuthenticationClass in order to provide certificates. If both spec.config.tls.secretClass and spec.config.clientAuthentication.authenticationClass are set, the authentication class will take precedence over the secret class. The cluster will be encrypted and authenticate only against the authentication class. Due to a bug in ZooKeeper, the clientPort property in combination with client.portUnification=true is used instead of the secureClientPort. This means that unencrypted and unauthenticated access to the ZooKeeper cluster is still possible. The managed ZooKeeper instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See Monitoring for more details. The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role). Overriding certain properties which are set by operator (such as the ports) can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems. For a role or role group, at the same level of config, you can specify: configOverrides for the zoo.cfg. For example, if you want to set the 4lw.commands.whitelist to allow the ruok administrative command, it can be configured in the ZookeeperCluster resource like so: servers: roleGroups: default: configOverrides: zoo.cfg: 4lw.commands.whitelist: \"srvr, ruok\" replicas: 1 Just as for the config, it is possible to specify this at role level as well: routers: configOverrides: zoo.cfg: 4lw.commands.whitelist: \"srvr, ruok\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 All override property values must be strings. For a full list of configuration options we refer to the Apache ZooKeeper Configuration Reference. In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group: servers: roleGroups: default: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" replicas: 1 or per role: servers: envOverrides: MY_ENV_VAR: \"MY_VALUE\" roleGroups: default: replicas: 1 You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifying PersistentVolumeClaims for each individual role group: servers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: storage: data: capacity: 2Gi In the above example, all ZooKeeper nodes in the default group will store data (the location of the property dataDir) on a 2Gi volume. By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a 1Gi large local volume mount for the data location. You can request a certain amount of memory for each individual role group as shown below: servers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: memory: limit: '2Gi' In this example, each ZooKeeper container in the \"default\" group will have a maximum of 2 gigabytes of memory. To be more precise, these memory limits apply to the containers running the ZooKeeper daemons but not to any sidecar containers that are part of the pod. Setting this property will also automatically set the maximum Java heap size for the corresponding process to 80% of the available memory. Be aware that if the memory constraint is too low, the cluster might fail to start. If pods terminate with an 'OOMKilled' status and the cluster doesn’t start, try increasing the memory limit. For more details regarding Kubernetes memory requests and limits see: Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods. Similarly to memory resources, you can also configure CPU limits, as shown below: servers: roleGroups: default: config: resources: cpu: max: '500m' min: '250m' For more details regarding Kubernetes CPU limits see: Assign CPU Resources to Containers and Pods.","title":"Usage","component":"zookeeper","version":"nightly","name":"usage","url":"/zookeeper/nightly/usage.html","titles":[{"text":"Encryption","hash":"_encryption","id":1},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":2},{"text":"Monitoring","hash":"_monitoring","id":3},{"text":"Configuration & Environment Overrides","hash":"_configuration_environment_overrides","id":4},{"text":"Configuration Properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":5},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"_environment_variables","id":6},{"text":"Storage for data volumes","hash":"_storage_for_data_volumes","id":7},{"text":"Memory requests","hash":"_memory_requests","id":8},{"text":"CPU requests","hash":"_cpu_requests","id":9}]},"455":{"id":455,"text":"Apache ZooKeeper organizes all data into a hierarchical system of ZNodes, which act as both files (they can have data associated with them) and folders (they can contain other ZNodes) when compared to a traditional (POSIX-like) file system.

Follow the installation steps for your platform. After you have installed stackablectl, use it to install the ZooKeeper Operator and its dependencies: stackablectl operator install \\ commons=0.3.0-nightly \\ secret=0.6.0-nightly \\ zookeeper=0.11.0-nightly The tool will show [INFO ] Installing commons operator in version 0.3.0-nightly [INFO ] Installing secret operator in version 0.6.0-nightly [INFO ] Installing zookeeper operator in version 0.11.0-nightly Consult the Quickstart to learn more about how to use stackablectl. For example, you can use the -k flag to create a Kubernetes cluster with kind. You can also use Helm to install the Operators. Add the Stackable Helm repository: helm repo add stackable-dev https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/helm-dev/ Then install the Stackable Operators: helm install --wait commons-operator stackable-dev/commons-operator --version 0.3.0-nightly helm install --wait secret-operator stackable-dev/secret-operator --version 0.6.0-nightly helm install --wait zookeeper-operator stackable-dev/zookeeper-operator --version 0.11.0-nightly Helm will deploy the Operators in a Kubernetes Deployment and apply the CRDs for the ZooKeeper cluster.
